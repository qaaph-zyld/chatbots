# Deployment Process Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment process for the Chatbot Platform, including the CI/CD pipeline, deployment strategies, and operational procedures. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators involved in the deployment process.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of the following stages:

### 1. Code Quality & Testing

- **Linting**: Ensures code adheres to our style guidelines
- **Unit Tests**: Verifies individual components work as expected
- **Integration Tests**: Verifies components work together correctly
- **Security Scan**: Identifies potential security vulnerabilities

### 2. Build & Packaging

- **Application Build**: Compiles and bundles the application
- **Docker Image Creation**: Packages the application into a Docker image
- **Image Tagging**: Tags images with appropriate version information

### 3. Deployment

- **Development Environment**: Automatic deployment on changes to the `develop` branch
- **Staging Environment**: Automatic deployment on changes to the `main` branch
- **Production Environment**: Deployment using blue/green strategy on changes to the `master` branch or manual trigger

### 4. Verification

- **Smoke Tests**: Quick tests to verify basic functionality
- **Verification Tests**: Comprehensive tests to verify deployment
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of application health

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue/Green Deployment

Our production environment uses a blue/green deployment strategy to minimize downtime and risk:

1. **Preparation**: The system identifies the currently active deployment (blue or green)
2. **Deployment**: The new version is deployed to the inactive environment
3. **Verification**: Automated tests verify the new deployment functions correctly
4. **Traffic Switch**: Traffic is switched from the active to the inactive environment
5. **Monitoring**: The system monitors the new deployment for issues
6. **Rollback**: If issues are detected, traffic is switched back to the previous environment

### Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment issues, the system can automatically roll back to the previous version:

1. **Failure Detection**: Automated tests or monitoring detects an issue
2. **Traffic Reversion**: Traffic is switched back to the previous environment
3. **Notification**: The team is notified of the rollback
4. **Investigation**: The issue is investigated and fixed

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment

- **Purpose**: Feature development and testing
- **URL**: https://dev.chatbot-platform.example.com
- **Kubernetes Namespace**: chatbot-platform-dev
- **Resource Limits**: Low (suitable for development)

### Staging Environment

- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **URL**: https://staging.chatbot-platform.example.com
- **Kubernetes Namespace**: chatbot-platform-staging
- **Resource Limits**: Medium (similar to production)

### Production Environment

- **Purpose**: Live customer-facing environment
- **URL**: https://chatbot-platform.example.com
- **Kubernetes Namespace**: chatbot-platform-prod
- **Resource Limits**: High (optimized for performance and reliability)

## Kubernetes Configuration

Our application is deployed to Kubernetes clusters with the following components:

- **Deployments**: Manage the application containers
- **Services**: Expose the application to the network
- **Ingress**: Route external traffic to services
- **ConfigMaps**: Store non-sensitive configuration
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive configuration
- **HorizontalPodAutoscalers**: Automatically scale based on load

## Deployment Verification

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests are quick tests that verify the basic functionality of the application after deployment. They check:

- Application health endpoints
- Core pages load correctly
- API endpoints respond correctly
- Static assets are served correctly

### Verification Tests

Verification tests are more comprehensive tests that verify the deployment functions correctly. They check:

- Health check endpoints
- API functionality
- Database connectivity
- External service integrations
- Performance metrics
- Frontend assets

## Monitoring & Alerting

After deployment, the application is continuously monitored for issues:

- **Health Checks**: Regular checks of application health endpoints
- **Metrics**: Collection of performance and usage metrics
- **Logs**: Collection and analysis of application logs
- **Alerts**: Notifications for critical issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Deployment Failures**: Check the CI/CD pipeline logs for errors
- **Application Crashes**: Check the application logs for errors
- **Performance Issues**: Check the metrics for anomalies
- **Database Issues**: Check the database logs and connections

### Support Contacts

- **DevOps Team**: devops@chatbot-platform.example.com
- **Development Team**: dev@chatbot-platform.example.com
- **Operations Team**: ops@chatbot-platform.example.com

## Security Considerations

- **Secrets Management**: Sensitive information is stored in Kubernetes Secrets
- **Network Security**: Traffic is encrypted using TLS
- **Access Control**: Access to environments is restricted based on role
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scanning for security vulnerabilities

## Compliance & Auditing

- **Deployment Logs**: All deployments are logged for auditing purposes
- **Change Management**: All changes follow the change management process
- **Approval Process**: Production deployments require approval

## Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the deployment process for the Chatbot Platform. It should be used as a reference for all deployment-related activities and updated as the process evolves.
