## Current Performance Assessment

Based on initial analysis, we've identified the following performance bottlenecks:

1. **Inefficient Database Queries**: Multiple redundant queries and missing indexes
2. **Memory Leaks**: In long-running processes and websocket connections
3. **Unoptimized Frontend Assets**: Large bundle sizes and render blocking resources
4. **Chatbot Processing Pipeline**: Sequential processing without parallelization
5. **Caching Strategy**: Insufficient or non-existent caching for frequently accessed data
6. **Connection Pooling**: Suboptimal database and external API connection management
7. **Resource-intensive Analytics**: Real-time analytics causing performance degradation
