# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the chatbot platform, covering all aspects of testing from unit tests to end-to-end integration tests. The goal is to ensure high quality, reliability, and performance of the platform before the MVP release.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, mocking any dependencies.

**Coverage Goals:**
- Core services: 90%+ coverage
- Utility functions: 95%+ coverage
- Models: 80%+ coverage
- Controllers: 85%+ coverage

**Tools:**
- Jest for test runner and assertions
- Sinon for mocks and stubs
- Istanbul for code coverage reporting

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly.

**Key Integration Points:**
- API endpoints with database
- Authentication flow
- Chatbot conversation flow
- Integration with external platforms (Slack, Web)
- Plugin system

**Tools:**
- Supertest for API testing
- MongoDB Memory Server for database testing

### 3. End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios across the entire application.

**Key Scenarios:**
- Complete user registration and authentication
- Chatbot creation and configuration
- Conversation with different personalities
- Knowledge base creation and querying
- Integration setup and messaging

**Tools:**
- Cypress for web interface testing
- Custom scripts for API workflow testing

### 4. Performance Testing

Performance tests ensure the application meets performance requirements under load.

**Key Metrics:**
- Response time: < 500ms for 95% of requests
- Throughput: Support for 100+ concurrent users
- Resource usage: < 70% CPU/memory under normal load

**Tools:**
- Artillery for load testing
- Prometheus for metrics collection

## Test Organization

Tests are organized by type and component:

```
src/tests/
├── unit/               # Unit tests
│   ├── services/       # Service unit tests
│   ├── controllers/    # Controller unit tests
│   ├── models/         # Model unit tests
│   └── utils/          # Utility function tests
├── integration/        # Integration tests
│   ├── api/            # API endpoint tests
│   ├── auth/           # Authentication flow tests
│   └── database/       # Database operation tests
├── e2e/                # End-to-end tests
│   ├── scenarios/      # User scenario tests
│   └── fixtures/       # Test data fixtures
└── performance/        # Performance tests
    ├── load/           # Load test scenarios
    └── stress/         # Stress test scenarios
```

## Continuous Integration

All tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Unit and integration tests run on every pull request
2. End-to-end tests run on merges to main branch
3. Performance tests run on a nightly schedule
4. Code coverage reports generated and tracked

## Test Data Management

Test data is managed through:

1. Fixtures for common test scenarios
2. Factory functions for generating test data
3. Seeding scripts for database preparation
4. Cleanup routines to ensure test isolation

## Mocking Strategy

External dependencies are mocked using:

1. Service mocks for external APIs
2. Database mocks for data operations
3. Environment variable overrides for configuration

## Reporting

Test results are reported through:

1. CI/CD pipeline integration
2. HTML coverage reports
3. JUnit XML for test results
4. Slack notifications for test failures

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Framework Setup**
   - Configure Jest and testing environment
   - Set up code coverage reporting
   - Create initial test helpers and utilities

2. **Phase 2: Core Service Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for core services
   - Create integration tests for key service interactions

3. **Phase 3: API Testing**
   - Implement tests for all API endpoints
   - Create authentication flow tests

4. **Phase 4: End-to-End Testing**
   - Implement key user scenarios
   - Create test fixtures and helpers

5. **Phase 5: Performance Testing**
   - Set up performance testing infrastructure
   - Create baseline performance tests

6. **Phase 6: CI/CD Integration**
   - Integrate all tests into CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up reporting and notifications
