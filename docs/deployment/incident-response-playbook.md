## Incident Classification

Incidents are classified based on their impact on the system and users:

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Resolution Time | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| P1 - Critical | Service is down or unusable for all users | Immediate | < 4 hours | Complete service outage |
| P2 - High | Major functionality is impacted for many users | < 30 minutes | < 8 hours | Authentication system failure |
| P3 - Medium | Minor functionality is impacted for some users | < 2 hours | < 24 hours | Non-critical feature unavailable |
| P4 - Low | Cosmetic issues or minor bugs | < 24 hours | < 1 week | UI alignment issues |

### Impact Assessment

To determine the severity of an incident, assess the following:

1. **User Impact**: How many users are affected?
2. **Functionality Impact**: What functionality is impacted?
3. **Data Impact**: Is data integrity or security compromised?
4. **Business Impact**: What is the business impact (revenue, reputation)?

## Response Team Structure

## Incident Response Workflow

### 1. Detection

- Alert triggered by monitoring system
- Reported by user or customer support
- Detected during routine checks

### 2. Triage

- Acknowledge the alert
- Assess severity and impact
- Determine if incident response is needed
- Assign initial responder

### 3. Response Initiation

- Create incident channel in Slack (#incident-{date}-{short-description})
- Assign incident commander
- Notify relevant team members
- Start incident documentation

### 4. Investigation

- Gather information about the incident
- Review logs, metrics, and traces
- Identify potential causes
- Document findings

### 5. Mitigation

- Implement immediate fixes to restore service
- Consider rollback if recent deployment
- Apply temporary workarounds if needed
- Verify effectiveness of mitigation

### 6. Resolution

- Implement permanent fixes
- Verify all systems are functioning properly
- Update documentation
- Close incident

### 7. Post-Incident Analysis

- Conduct post-mortem meeting
- Document root cause
- Identify preventive measures
- Create follow-up tasks

## Communication Protocols

### Internal Communication

#### Slack Channels

- **#incidents**: For all active incidents
- **#incident-{date}-{short-description}**: Dedicated channel for each incident
- **#alerts**: For automated alerts

#### Status Updates

- Provide regular updates (every 30 minutes for P1/P2, every 2 hours for P3/P4)
- Include current status, actions taken, and next steps
- Use @here for important updates

### External Communication

#### Customer Communication

- Update status page
- Send email notifications for major incidents
- Provide estimated resolution time if possible
- Follow up when resolved

#### Status Page Updates

- Update within 10 minutes of incident detection
- Provide clear, non-technical description
- Include workarounds if available
- Update when resolved

## Common Incidents and Resolution Steps

### 1. Service Outage

#### Symptoms

- All requests failing
- 5xx errors across all endpoints
- Health checks failing

#### Initial Response

1. Check if recent deployment occurred
2. Verify Kubernetes pod status
3. Check database connectivity
4. Review error logs

#### Resolution Steps

1. If recent deployment, consider rollback
2. If pod issues, restart pods or scale up
3. If database issues, check connection pool and queries
4. If external dependency issues, implement circuit breaker

### 2. High Latency

#### Symptoms

- Slow response times
- Timeouts
- Increased error rates

#### Initial Response

1. Check system resource usage (CPU, memory)
2. Review database query performance
3. Check external service latency
4. Review recent traffic patterns

#### Resolution Steps

1. If resource contention, scale up resources
2. If database issues, optimize queries or add indexes
3. If external service issues, implement caching or circuit breaker
4. If traffic spike, implement rate limiting or add capacity

### 3. Authentication Failures

#### Symptoms

- Users unable to log in
- 401/403 errors
- Token validation failures

#### Initial Response

1. Check authentication service status
2. Verify JWT secret and configuration
3. Check database connectivity
4. Review auth service logs

#### Resolution Steps

1. If configuration issue, update configuration
2. If database issue, restore connectivity
3. If token issue, rotate keys if compromised
4. If service issue, restart or rollback

### 4. Database Issues

#### Symptoms

- Query timeouts
- Connection errors
- High CPU/memory usage

#### Initial Response

1. Check database metrics (connections, queries, locks)
2. Review slow query logs
3. Check disk space and IOPS
4. Verify replication status

#### Resolution Steps

1. If connection pool exhaustion, increase pool size
2. If slow queries, optimize or kill long-running queries
3. If disk space issue, free up space or scale storage
4. If replication issue, fix replication or failover

### 5. Memory Leaks

#### Symptoms

- Increasing memory usage over time
- OOM errors
- Pod restarts

#### Initial Response

1. Take heap dump for analysis
2. Review memory usage patterns
3. Check for recent code changes
4. Temporarily increase memory limits

#### Resolution Steps

1. Identify leaking component
2. Deploy fix for memory leak
3. Restart affected services
4. Monitor memory usage

## Post-Incident Analysis

### Post-Mortem Meeting

- Schedule within 48 hours of incident resolution
- Include all responders and stakeholders
- Focus on process improvement, not blame
- Document findings and action items

### Post-Mortem Document Template

```
