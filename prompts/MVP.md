- Core chatbot engine with conversation handling
- External REST API with comprehensive documentation
- Web widget for easy embedding
- Conversation analytics and tracking
- Knowledge base integration
- Template system for common use cases
- Learning from conversations with feedback collection and model fine-tuning
- Advanced context awareness with entity tracking, user preference learning, and topic detection

- Customization guide

## Technical Requirements

### Backend
- Node.js server with Express
- MongoDB for data storage
- Basic NLP integration (e.g., with an existing library)
- RESTful API for chatbot interactions

### Frontend
- React-based UI for configuration
- Chat interface component
- Basic analytics dashboard

### Infrastructure
- Containerized deployment
- Basic monitoring
- Secure API endpoints

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

1. Users can create a customized chatbot within 30 minutes
2. Chatbots can maintain context through a conversation of at least 10 exchanges
3. Customization options allow for at least 3 distinctly different chatbot personalities
4. Knowledge base integration works with at least 3 different data formats
5. Chatbots can be successfully deployed and embedded in a website
6. API allows for basic integration with external systems

## Out of Scope for MVP

The following features are explicitly out of scope for the MVP but planned for future releases:

- Voice interfaces (though foundational work has begun)
- Multi-language support beyond basic capabilities
- Enterprise features (SSO, advanced RBAC, etc.)
- Marketplace for chatbot templates
- Mobile app interfaces
- Advanced integrations beyond webhooks and REST API

**Note**: We have already implemented some features that were originally out of scope, including advanced NLP capabilities, sentiment analysis, and conversation analytics.

## Timeline

The MVP is targeted for completion within 4 months from project kickoff, with the following milestones:

- Month 1: Core architecture and basic chatbot engine âœ…
- Month 2: Customization framework and user interface âœ…
- Month 3: Deployment capabilities, external API, and web widget âœ…
- Month 4: Learning from conversations, advanced context awareness, and final testing ðŸ”„

## Proxy Configuration

All external connections in the MVP must support the organization's proxy configuration (104.129.196.38:10563). This includes:

- API clients
- External service integrations
- Package managers and dependency installation
- Webhooks and external callbacks
