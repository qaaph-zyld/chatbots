## In Progress Tasks

### Testing
- ✅ Run tests to verify functionality after migration
- ⬜ Fix any broken tests or import issues

## Completed Tasks (continued)

### File Migration
- ✅ Move configuration files from `src/config/` to `configs/`
- ✅ Move domain models from `src/models/` to `src/domain/`
- ✅ Move services from `src/services/` to `src/modules/` with appropriate subdirectories
- ✅ Move test files from `src/tests/` to `tests/` with appropriate subdirectories

### Import Path Updates
- ✅ Update import paths throughout the codebase to use module aliases
- ✅ Created and executed `scripts/update-imports.js` to automate path updates

## Remaining Tasks

### Documentation Updates
- ⬜ Update API documentation to reflect new structure
- ⬜ Create onboarding guide for new developers

### CI/CD Updates
- ⬜ Update CI/CD pipelines for new directory structure
- ⬜ Add automated testing with MongoDB Memory Server

### Team Communication
- ⬜ Share migration plan and changes with the team
- ⬜ Schedule code reviews and testing sessions

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run the migration scripts to move files to their new locations:
   ```
   node scripts/migrate-files.js --dry-run
   node scripts/migrate-files.js
   ```

2. ✅ Update import paths throughout the codebase:
   ```
   node scripts/update-imports.js --dry-run
   node scripts/update-imports.js
   ```

3. ✅ Run tests to verify functionality after migration:
   ```
   npm run test:unit
   npm run test:memory
   npm run test:integration
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

4. Fix any remaining broken tests or import issues that arise during testing

5. Update API documentation to reflect the new structure

6. Create onboarding guide for new developers

7. Update CI/CD pipelines for the new directory structure
