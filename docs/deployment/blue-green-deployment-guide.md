# Blue/Green Deployment Strategy Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the blue/green deployment strategy implemented for the Chatbot Platform. Blue/green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green.

## How It Works

1. At any time, only one of the environments (Blue or Green) is live and serving production traffic.
2. When deploying a new version:
   - The new version is deployed to the inactive environment
   - Tests are run against the new deployment
   - If tests pass, traffic is switched to the new environment
   - The previously active environment becomes inactive

## Benefits

- **Zero Downtime**: Users experience no downtime during deployments
- **Easy Rollback**: If issues are detected, traffic can be immediately routed back to the previous environment
- **Testing in Production**: The new version can be fully tested in a production-like environment before receiving traffic
- **Reduced Risk**: Deployment issues affect only the inactive environment, not users

## Implementation Details

### Infrastructure Components

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Hosts both Blue and Green environments
- **Service**: Acts as the traffic router between environments
- **Deployments**: Separate Blue and Green deployments with identical resources
- **Ingress/Load Balancer**: Exposes the service externally

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Our GitHub Actions workflow automates the blue/green deployment process:

1. **Determine Active Color**: Identifies which environment (Blue or Green) is currently active
2. **Deploy to Inactive**: Deploys the new version to the inactive environment
3. **Run Tests**: Executes smoke tests and verification tests against the new deployment
4. **Switch Traffic**: Updates the service selector to point to the new deployment
5. **Verify Health**: Confirms the new deployment is healthy after the switch
6. **Rollback (if needed)**: Automatically reverts to the previous environment if any step fails

## Deployment Verification

Before switching traffic, the following verification steps are performed:

1. **Smoke Tests**: Basic tests to verify core functionality
2. **Verification Tests**: More comprehensive tests to ensure all critical paths work
3. **Health Checks**: Endpoint monitoring to confirm service availability

## Monitoring During Deployment

During and after deployment, the following metrics are monitored:

- **Error Rate**: Increase in HTTP 5xx responses
- **Response Time**: Latency percentiles (p50, p90, p99)
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Business Metrics**: User activity, conversion rates, etc.

## Rollback Procedure

### Automated Rollback

The CI/CD pipeline automatically rolls back to the previous environment if:
- Smoke tests fail
- Verification tests fail
- Health checks fail after traffic switch

### Manual Rollback

To manually roll back a deployment:

```bash
# Identify current color
CURRENT_COLOR=$(kubectl get service chatbot-platform -n chatbot-platform-prod -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector.color}')

# Determine rollback color
if [[ "$CURRENT_COLOR" == "blue" ]]; then
  ROLLBACK_COLOR="green"
else
  ROLLBACK_COLOR="blue"
fi

# Switch traffic back
kubectl patch service chatbot-platform -n chatbot-platform-prod -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"color":"'"$ROLLBACK_COLOR"'"}}}'
```

## Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful Deployment

1. New version is deployed to inactive environment
2. All tests pass
3. Traffic is switched to the new environment
4. Deployment is marked as successful

### Scenario 2: Failed Tests

1. New version is deployed to inactive environment
2. Tests fail
3. Traffic remains on the current active environment
4. Deployment is marked as failed
5. Development team is notified

### Scenario 3: Post-Deployment Issues

1. New version is deployed to inactive environment
2. All tests pass
3. Traffic is switched to the new environment
4. Monitoring detects issues (high error rate, latency, etc.)
5. Manual or automated rollback is triggered
6. Traffic is switched back to the previous environment

## Best Practices

1. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to control the activation of new features
2. **Database Migrations**: Ensure backward compatibility for database changes
3. **API Versioning**: Maintain compatibility between versions
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for key metrics during and after deployments
5. **Deployment Windows**: Schedule deployments during low-traffic periods
6. **Canary Testing**: Consider implementing canary testing before full deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Deployment fails | Resource limits, image pull errors | Check logs, ensure resources are available |
| Tests fail | Application bugs, environment issues | Review test logs, check environment variables |
| High error rate after switch | Application bugs, configuration issues | Check application logs, consider rollback |
| Increased latency | Resource constraints, inefficient code | Scale resources, optimize code |

## Conclusion

The blue/green deployment strategy provides a robust approach to deploying new versions of the Chatbot Platform with minimal risk and downtime. By following this guide, the team can ensure smooth and reliable deployments.
