- Documented rollback procedures

#### Days 3-4: Production Readiness

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for production
- [ ] Implement health checks for all critical services
- [ ] Create operational runbooks for common issues
- [ ] Perform security review of payment processes
- [ ] Conduct load testing of subscription services

**Deliverables:**
- Production-ready monitoring and alerting
- Operational documentation for support team
- Security validation report
- Performance validation report

#### Day 5: Final Testing & Launch Preparation

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of complete monetization flow
- [ ] Verify all error handling and recovery processes
- [ ] Test monitoring and alerting systems
- [ ] Prepare launch announcement and documentation
- [ ] Create customer support training materials

**Deliverables:**

- Launch readiness assessment
- Customer support documentation

## Resource Allocation

- **Backend Developer**: Primary focus on payment integration, subscription lifecycle, and error handling
- **Frontend Developer**: Focus on admin dashboard and subscription portal UI
- **DevOps Engineer**: Focus on CI/CD pipeline and production readiness
- **QA Engineer**: Focus on testing all components and validating error handling

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- Stripe API access and test credentials
- Production environment access for deployment
- Admin permissions for CI/CD setup

### Risks
- **Stripe API Changes**: Monitor for any API changes during implementation
- **Security Concerns**: Ensure PCI compliance for all payment handling
- **Integration Complexity**: Allow buffer time for unexpected integration issues

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All critical gaps identified in the gap analysis are addressed
2. End-to-end subscription flows are working in production
3. Admin dashboard provides necessary visibility and control
4. Error handling robustly manages payment failures
5. CI/CD pipeline enables safe, automated deployments

## Post-MVP Enhancements

After achieving the MVP, the following enhancements should be considered:

1. Advanced analytics for subscription metrics
2. Customer self-service portal enhancements
3. Additional payment methods beyond credit cards
4. Subscription usage reporting
5. Advanced revenue optimization features

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap to address the critical gaps in our monetization system. By following this plan, we can achieve a production-ready monetization MVP within 2-3 weeks, enabling the business to start generating revenue from the platform.
