# Open-Source Chatbots Platform Governance Model

This document outlines the governance model for the Open-Source Chatbots Platform project. It defines how decisions are made, how contributors can become maintainers, and how the project is managed.

## Project Vision

The Open-Source Chatbots Platform aims to provide a fully open-source solution for creating customizable chatbots with advanced AI capabilities, including voice interface - all without relying on proprietary services. Our vision is to democratize conversational AI technology and make it accessible to everyone.

## Governance Structure

The project follows a meritocratic governance model with the following roles:

### 1. Users

Users are community members who use the Open-Source Chatbots Platform. They contribute to the project by:

- Providing feedback on features and bugs
- Participating in community discussions
- Helping other users
- Promoting the project

### 2. Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute to the project in various ways:

- Submitting code changes via pull requests
- Improving documentation
- Creating issues for bugs or feature requests
- Participating in design discussions
- Contributing to the roadmap

Anyone can become a contributor by submitting a pull request or making other valuable contributions to the project.

### 3. Maintainers

Maintainers are contributors who have shown dedication to the project and have been given write access to the repository. They are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging issues
- Guiding contributors
- Ensuring code quality
- Making technical decisions for their area of expertise

To become a maintainer, a contributor must:
1. Have made substantial contributions to the project
2. Be familiar with the codebase and project goals
3. Demonstrate good judgment in technical decisions
4. Be nominated by an existing maintainer and approved by the core team

### 4. Core Team

The core team consists of maintainers who have been given additional responsibilities for the overall direction and management of the project. They are responsible for:

- Setting the project vision and roadmap
- Making major architectural decisions
- Managing the release process
- Resolving conflicts
- Ensuring the project's sustainability

The core team operates on a consensus basis for major decisions.

## Decision Making Process

The project follows these decision-making processes:

### Day-to-Day Decisions

For routine decisions (bug fixes, minor features, documentation improvements):
- Maintainers can approve and merge pull requests in their area of expertise
- At least one maintainer approval is required for any change
- Maintainers should seek input from other maintainers when changes affect multiple areas

### Significant Changes

For significant changes (major features, breaking changes, architectural decisions):
1. A proposal is created as a GitHub issue or discussion
2. The proposal is discussed by the community
3. Maintainers and core team members review the proposal
4. The core team makes the final decision based on consensus
5. If consensus cannot be reached, the core team may vote, with a simple majority required

### Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise between contributors or maintainers:
1. The involved parties should first attempt to resolve the conflict directly
2. If that fails, a core team member will mediate the discussion
3. If mediation fails, the core team will make a final decision

## Contribution Process

The project follows a standard GitHub workflow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request
5. Address feedback from reviewers
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your changes

All contributions must adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](./03_Development_Methodologies/01_Code_Standards.md#code-of-conduct) and [Contributing Guidelines](./DOCUMENTATION_CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Release Management

The project follows a time-based release schedule:

- Major releases: Every 6 months
- Minor releases: Every 2 months
- Patch releases: As needed for critical bug fixes

The release process is managed by the core team, with input from maintainers and the community.

## Working Groups

The project may establish working groups to focus on specific areas:

1. **Voice Interface Working Group**: Focuses on speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and voice recognition
2. **NLP Working Group**: Focuses on natural language processing capabilities
3. **UI/UX Working Group**: Focuses on user interfaces and experience
4. **Documentation Working Group**: Focuses on improving documentation
5. **Integration Working Group**: Focuses on platform integrations

Working groups are led by maintainers with expertise in the relevant area and are open to all contributors.

## Funding and Resources

The project is currently community-supported. Funding decisions are made by the core team with transparency to the community. All financial contributions and expenditures will be publicly documented.

## Code of Conduct

All community members must adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](./03_Development_Methodologies/01_Code_Standards.md#code-of-conduct). Violations will be addressed by the core team according to the enforcement guidelines in the Code of Conduct.

## Amendments to Governance

Changes to this governance model can be proposed by any community member. Proposals will be discussed by the community, and significant changes require approval by the core team.
