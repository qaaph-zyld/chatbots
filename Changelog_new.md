- Used unittest framework as the foundation for test cases
- Implemented custom TestSuite and SQLAgentTestCase classes for changelog integration
- Added detailed performance metrics tracking for all test operations
- Created validation suite with quality gates for pass rate and execution time
- Followed mandatory changelog protocol at all testing stages:
  - Pre-Response: Changelog update execution
  - Response Body: Core functionality delivery
  - Post-Response: System validation
  - Error Handling: Recovery protocol activation

#### Next Actions Required:
- Implement integration tests for cross-component functionality
- Add performance tests with benchmarking capabilities
- Create security validation tests for input sanitization
- Integrate test runner with CI/CD pipeline
- Expand test coverage for all SQL Agent components
- Implement automated test report generation
