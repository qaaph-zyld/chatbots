# Chatbots Project Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Chatbots project. This documentation has been reorganized to align with the `dev_framework` principles, providing a structured approach to documenting testing strategies, security and DevOps practices, and development methodologies.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into four main categories:

### [01_Testing_Strategies](./01_Testing_Strategies/README.md)

Documentation related to testing strategies, methodologies, and best practices:

- Unit Testing Approach
- Integration Testing
- End-to-End Testing
- Test Automation

### [02_Security_and_DevOps](./02_Security_and_DevOps/README.md)

Documentation related to security practices, DevOps processes, and operational considerations:

- Security Practices
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Deployment Strategy
- Monitoring

### [03_Development_Methodologies](./03_Development_Methodologies/README.md)

Documentation related to development methodologies, coding standards, architectural patterns, and design principles:

- Code Standards
- Architecture Patterns
- API Design
- Component Structure

### [04_Project_Specifics](./04_Project_Specifics/README.md)

Documentation for project-specific aspects that don't fit neatly into the standard dev_framework categories:

- Custom Components
- Prompt Engineering
- Community Features

## Legacy Documentation

The existing documentation is being gradually migrated to the new structure. Until the migration is complete, you can still access all documentation files directly in the `docs` directory.

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Identify the appropriate category for your documentation
2. Create a new Markdown file in the corresponding directory
3. Follow the naming convention: `XX_Descriptive_Name.md` where `XX` is the next available number in the directory
4. Update the README.md file in the directory to include a reference to your new file
5. Update the CHANGELOG.md in the project root to reflect your documentation changes

## Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include a clear title and description at the top of each file
- Use headings to organize content
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Cross-reference related documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
