# Prompt Engineering

This document provides documentation for prompt engineering practices and templates used in the Chatbots project.

## Overview

Prompt engineering is a critical aspect of our chatbot platform, enabling effective communication between users and AI models. This document outlines our approach to prompt design, templates, and best practices to ensure consistent, high-quality interactions.

## Prompt Directory

Prompt-related resources are located in the `/prompts` directory at the project root. This directory contains various markdown files with guidelines, templates, and examples for different types of prompts.

## Key Prompt Documents

### Best Practices

The `BEST_PRACTICES.md` file outlines our recommended approaches for designing effective prompts. It covers:

- Clarity and specificity in instructions
- Handling context and memory
- Managing tone and personality
- Error recovery strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

### Implementation Protocol

The `IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md` file provides structured guidelines for implementing new prompts in the system. It includes:

- Prompt development lifecycle
- Testing and validation procedures
- Version control for prompts
- Documentation requirements
- Review process

### Continuation Prompts

The `CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md` file focuses on techniques for maintaining context and coherence across multiple turns of conversation. It addresses:

- Context preservation strategies
- Memory management
- Handling conversation state
- Preventing repetition and loops
- Managing token limitations

### Roadmap

The `ROADMAP.md` and `OPEN_SOURCE_ROADMAP.md` files outline the planned evolution of our prompt engineering capabilities, including:

- Upcoming prompt templates
- Integration with new AI models
- Enhanced personalization features
- Multilingual support expansion
- Community contribution guidelines

## Prompt Templates

Our chatbot platform uses several standardized prompt templates for different conversation scenarios:

### Greeting Template

```
You are {bot_name}, a helpful assistant for {company_name}.
Your primary goal is to {primary_goal}.
When greeting a user:
1. Be friendly and professional
2. Introduce yourself briefly
3. Ask how you can help
4. {custom_instruction}

User: {user_input}
```

### Support Template

```
You are {bot_name}, a support assistant for {company_name}.
Context: {user_context}
Previous conversation: {conversation_history}

Guidelines:
- Focus on resolving the user's issue efficiently
- Use a {tone} tone
- Offer step-by-step solutions when appropriate
- Escalate to human support if {escalation_criteria}
- {custom_instruction}

User issue: {user_input}
```

### Error Recovery Template

The `error_recovery_terminal_run.md` file contains specialized prompts for handling and recovering from errors, particularly in terminal operations. These prompts help the chatbot:

- Diagnose common error patterns
- Suggest appropriate remediation steps
- Prevent cascading failures
- Provide educational context about the error

## Prompt Variables

Our prompt templates use variables to customize behavior based on user context, conversation history, and application settings:

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| bot_name | Name of the chatbot instance | "SupportBot" |
| company_name | Organization name | "Acme Corp" |
| primary_goal | Main objective of the bot | "help users troubleshoot network issues" |
| tone | Conversational style | "friendly but professional" |
| user_context | Relevant user information | "Premium customer, using mobile app v2.1" |
| custom_instruction | Scenario-specific guidance | "Prioritize self-service solutions" |

## Developer Persona

The `world_class_developer_persona.md` file defines the characteristics and behavior of our developer-focused chatbot persona. This persona is designed to:

- Communicate effectively with technical users
- Provide accurate and helpful coding assistance
- Follow software development best practices
- Balance technical depth with accessibility

## Testing and Evaluation

Our prompt engineering process includes rigorous testing and evaluation:

1. **A/B Testing**: Comparing different prompt variations to identify the most effective approaches
2. **User Satisfaction Metrics**: Tracking user ratings and feedback on bot responses
3. **Task Completion Rate**: Measuring how often the bot successfully resolves user queries
4. **Conversation Analysis**: Reviewing conversation logs to identify patterns and improvement opportunities

## Best Practices for Creating New Prompts

When creating new prompts for the chatbot platform, follow these guidelines:

1. **Start with a clear goal**: Define what the prompt should accomplish
2. **Be specific and explicit**: Provide clear instructions and context
3. **Layer information**: Present the most important information first
4. **Test variations**: Create multiple versions and test their effectiveness
5. **Include examples**: Demonstrate desired outputs when appropriate
6. **Consider edge cases**: Anticipate unusual or challenging inputs
7. **Maintain consistency**: Align with the established tone and style
8. **Document thoroughly**: Include comments and explanations

## Integration with AI Models

Our prompt engineering approach is designed to work effectively with various AI models:

- **GPT-4**: Optimized for complex reasoning and nuanced understanding
- **Claude**: Leverages constitutional AI principles for safer outputs
- **LLAMA**: Adapted for efficient operation in resource-constrained environments
- **Custom Models**: Tailored prompts for domain-specific fine-tuned models
