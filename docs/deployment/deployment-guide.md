## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process. It is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of the following stages:

### 1. Code Quality

- **Linting**: ESLint checks for code quality
- **Unit Tests**: Jest tests for individual components
- **Integration Tests**: API and service integration tests

### 2. Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit and OWASP Dependency Check
- **Static Code Analysis**: SonarQube for code quality and security
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for container vulnerabilities

### 3. Build

- **Application Build**: npm build for frontend and backend
- **Docker Build**: Building Docker images
- **Image Tagging**: Tagging images with Git SHA and version

### 4. Deployment

- **Development**: Automatic deployment to development environment
- **Staging**: Automatic deployment to staging environment
- **Production**: Blue-green deployment to production environment

### 5. Verification

- **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality tests
- **UI Verification**: UI functionality tests
- **Performance Tests**: Load and performance tests
- **Security Tests**: Security verification tests

### 6. Monitoring

- **Deployment Monitoring**: Monitoring deployment health
- **Alerting**: Sending alerts for issues
- **Reporting**: Generating deployment reports

### CI/CD Workflow

The CI/CD workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` and is triggered by:

- **Push to `develop`**: Triggers deployment to development environment
- **Push to `main`**: Triggers deployment to staging environment
- **Push to `master`**: Triggers deployment to production environment
- **Manual Trigger**: Allows manual deployment to any environment

## Blue-Green Deployment

The production environment uses a blue-green deployment strategy to minimize downtime and risk.

### Blue-Green Deployment Process

1. **Identify Active Deployment**: Determine whether blue or green is currently active
2. **Deploy to Inactive Environment**: Deploy new version to the inactive environment
3. **Run Verification Tests**: Run tests against the new deployment
4. **Switch Traffic**: If tests pass, switch traffic to the new deployment
5. **Monitor**: Monitor the new deployment for issues
6. **Rollback or Clean Up**: Either rollback if issues are detected or clean up the old deployment

### Blue-Green Implementation

The blue-green deployment is implemented using Kubernetes services and deployments:

- **Deployments**: `chatbot-platform-blue` and `chatbot-platform-green`
- **Service**: `chatbot-platform` that routes traffic to either blue or green

The deployment script (`scripts/deployment/blue-green.js`) handles the blue-green deployment process.

## Deployment Verification

Deployment verification ensures that the new deployment is functioning correctly before switching traffic. It consists of the following tests:

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests verify basic functionality:

- **Health Endpoints**: Verify health endpoints return 200 OK
- **Static Assets**: Verify static assets are served correctly
- **API Endpoints**: Verify key API endpoints are accessible
- **Database Connectivity**: Verify database connections are working
- **External Service Connectivity**: Verify connections to external services

Implementation: `tests/smoke/smoke-tests.js`

### UI Verification Tests

UI verification tests verify user interface functionality:

- **Page Loading**: Verify pages load correctly
- **Navigation**: Verify navigation between pages works
- **Forms**: Verify forms submit correctly
- **CRUD Operations**: Verify create, read, update, delete operations
- **Responsive Design**: Verify responsive design works on different screen sizes

Implementation: `tests/verification/ui-verification.js`

### Performance Tests

Performance tests verify that the application meets performance requirements:

- **Response Time**: Verify response times are within acceptable limits
- **Throughput**: Verify the system can handle the expected load
- **Error Rate**: Verify error rates are within acceptable limits
- **Resource Utilization**: Verify CPU, memory, and network usage are within limits

Implementation: `tests/performance/performance-tests.js`

### Security Tests

Security tests verify that the application meets security requirements:

- **Security Headers**: Verify security headers are correctly set
- **Authentication**: Verify authentication works correctly
- **Authorization**: Verify authorization controls access correctly
- **Input Validation**: Verify input validation prevents common attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Verify rate limiting prevents abuse

Implementation: `tests/security/security-tests.js`

## Monitoring and Alerting

Monitoring and alerting ensure that issues are detected and addressed promptly.

### Monitoring Components

- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from the application and infrastructure
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and provides dashboards
- **ELK Stack**: Collects and analyzes logs
- **Custom Monitoring Script**: `scripts/deployment/monitoring.js`

### Monitored Metrics

- **Deployment Status**: Replicas, availability, readiness
- **Pod Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Application Metrics**: Request rate, error rate, response time
- **Log Analysis**: Error patterns, exceptions

### Alerting Channels

- **Slack**: For non-critical alerts and notifications
- **PagerDuty**: For critical alerts requiring immediate attention
- **Email**: For summary reports and non-urgent notifications

### Alert Thresholds

- **CPU Usage**: > 80% (warning), > 90% (critical)
- **Memory Usage**: > 1GB (warning), > 1.5GB (critical)
- **Error Rate**: > 5% (warning), > 10% (critical)
- **Response Time**: > 500ms (warning), > 1s (critical)

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected after deployment, the rollback procedure ensures quick recovery.

### Automated Rollback

The CI/CD pipeline includes an automated rollback procedure that is triggered when verification tests fail. The rollback script (`scripts/deployment/rollback.js`) performs the following steps:

1. **Identify Previous Version**: Determine the previous stable version
2. **Roll Back Deployment**: Use `kubectl rollout undo` to revert to the previous version
3. **Verify Rollback**: Verify the rollback was successful
4. **Send Notifications**: Notify the team about the rollback

### Manual Rollback

If the automated rollback fails, follow these steps to manually roll back the deployment:

1. **Identify Previous Version**: Determine the previous stable version
2. **Switch Traffic**: Update the service to point to the previous version
   ```bash
   kubectl patch service chatbot-platform -n chatbot-platform-prod -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"color":"blue"}}}'
   ```
3. **Verify Rollback**: Verify the application is functioning correctly
4. **Notify Team**: Notify the team about the rollback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Deployment Failures

**Issue**: Deployment fails to create pods
**Solution**: Check pod events, logs, and resource constraints

```bash
# Check pod events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Check resource usage
kubectl top pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

**Issue**: Pods are in CrashLoopBackOff state
**Solution**: Check container logs for errors

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous
```

#### Verification Test Failures

**Issue**: Smoke tests fail
**Solution**: Check application logs, verify connectivity to dependencies

**Issue**: UI verification tests fail
**Solution**: Check for UI changes, update tests if necessary

**Issue**: Performance tests fail
**Solution**: Check for performance regressions, optimize code, increase resources
