# CI/CD Pipeline

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Chatbots project, aligned with the `dev_framework` principles.

## Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. This ensures consistent quality, reduces manual errors, and enables rapid delivery of new features.

## Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline consists of several stages, each with specific responsibilities:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│    Build    │────▶│     Lint    │────▶│    Test     │────▶│   Package   │────▶│   Deploy    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                                             │
                                             ▼
                                      ┌─────────────┐
                                      │   Security  │
                                      │    Scan     │
                                      └─────────────┘
```

## CI/CD Tools

We use the following tools for our CI/CD pipeline:

- **GitHub Actions**: Primary CI/CD platform
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments
- **npm**: Package management and scripts
- **Jest**: Test runner
- **ESLint**: Code quality and style checking
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Build

The build stage compiles and prepares the application for testing and deployment:

- Install dependencies
- Compile TypeScript (if applicable)
- Generate necessary assets
- Validate project structure

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions build step
build:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '16.x'
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
```

### 2. Lint

The lint stage checks code quality and style:

- ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Prettier for code formatting
- Custom linting rules for project-specific standards

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions lint step
lint:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: build
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '16.x'
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Lint
      run: npm run lint
```

### 3. Test

The test stage runs automated tests to verify functionality:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Coverage reporting

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions test step
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: lint
  services:
    mongodb:
      image: mongo:4.4
      ports:
        - 27017:27017
    redis:
      image: redis:6
      ports:
        - 6379:6379
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '16.x'
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm run test:ci
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: coverage
        path: coverage/
```

### 4. Security Scan

The security scan stage checks for vulnerabilities:

- Dependency scanning
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Secret detection
- License compliance

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions security scan step
security:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: test
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '16.x'
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Run Snyk
      uses: snyk/actions/node@master
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

### 5. Package

The package stage prepares the application for deployment:

- Create Docker images
- Generate deployment artifacts
- Version tagging
- Artifact storage

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions package step
package:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [test, security]
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
    - name: Login to DockerHub
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
    - name: Build and push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
      with:
        push: true
        tags: organization/chatbots:latest,organization/chatbots:${{ github.sha }}
```

### 6. Deploy

The deploy stage releases the application to the target environment:

- Environment-specific configuration
- Database migrations
- Zero-downtime deployment
- Post-deployment verification

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions deploy step
deploy:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: package
  environment: production
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      uses: steebchen/kubectl@v2
      with:
        config: ${{ secrets.KUBE_CONFIG_DATA }}
        command: set image deployment/chatbots chatbots=organization/chatbots:${{ github.sha }}
    - name: Verify deployment
      uses: steebchen/kubectl@v2
      with:
        config: ${{ secrets.KUBE_CONFIG_DATA }}
        command: rollout status deployment/chatbots
```

## Environment-Specific Pipelines

We maintain separate pipelines for different environments:

### Development Pipeline

- Triggered on every push to feature branches
- Runs build, lint, and test stages
- Deploys to development environment
- Fast feedback for developers

### Staging Pipeline

- Triggered on merges to the `develop` branch
- Runs all stages
- Deploys to staging environment
- Integration testing and UAT

### Production Pipeline

- Triggered on merges to the `main` branch
- Runs all stages with additional security checks
- Requires manual approval for deployment
- Deploys to production environment
- Includes rollback capability

## Monitoring and Notifications

- Pipeline status notifications via Slack/Teams
- Failure alerts to responsible teams
- Performance metrics for pipeline stages
- Deployment tracking and history

## Best Practices

1. **Keep pipelines fast**: Optimize for quick feedback
2. **Fail early**: Run quick checks first to provide early feedback
3. **Parallel execution**: Run independent stages in parallel
4. **Idempotent deployments**: Ensure deployments can be repeated safely
5. **Environment parity**: Keep environments as similar as possible
6. **Infrastructure as Code**: Version control all pipeline configurations
7. **Secrets management**: Securely handle sensitive information
