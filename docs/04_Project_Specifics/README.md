# Project-Specific Documentation

This section contains documentation for project-specific aspects of the Chatbots platform that don't fit neatly into the standard dev_framework categories.

## Overview

While the dev_framework provides a comprehensive structure for documenting testing strategies, security and DevOps practices, and development methodologies, every project has unique elements that require special attention. This section addresses those project-specific aspects.

## Contents

1. [Custom Components](./01_Custom_Components.md) - Documentation for custom UI components specific to this project
2. [Prompt Engineering](./02_Prompt_Engineering.md) - Documentation for prompt engineering practices and templates
3. [Community Features](./03_Community_Features.md) - Documentation for community engagement features

## Integration with dev_framework

This section extends the standard dev_framework documentation structure to accommodate project-specific needs while maintaining consistency with the overall documentation approach. Cross-references to the standard sections are provided where appropriate.
