# Chatbot Platform Deployment Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying the Chatbot Platform in various environments, including self-hosting options. The platform is designed to be deployed using Docker containers, with support for both single-server and distributed deployments.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Docker Deployment (Recommended)

The simplest way to deploy the Chatbot Platform is using Docker and Docker Compose.

#### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine (version 20.10.0 or later)
- Docker Compose (version 2.0.0 or later)
- Git
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 20GB disk space minimum

#### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/chatbots.git
   cd chatbots
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file to set your configuration options.

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Verify the deployment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
   All services should be in the "Up" state.

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment

For production environments with high availability requirements, Kubernetes deployment is recommended.

#### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (version 1.20 or later)
- kubectl command-line tool
- Helm (version 3.0.0 or later)
- Persistent storage provider

#### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/chatbots.git
   cd chatbots/kubernetes
   ```

2. Configure the Helm values:
   ```bash
   cp values.yaml my-values.yaml
   ```
   Edit `my-values.yaml` to set your configuration options.

3. Install the Helm chart:
   ```bash
   helm install chatbots-platform ./helm-chart -f my-values.yaml
   ```

4. Verify the deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   All pods should be in the "Running" state.

5. Get the service URL:
   ```bash
   kubectl get svc chatbots-platform
   ```
   Access the application using the external IP or domain name.

### 3. Manual Deployment

For environments where Docker or Kubernetes is not available, manual deployment is supported.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or later)
- MongoDB (version 6.0 or later)
- Redis (version 7.0 or later)
- Git
- npm or yarn

#### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/chatbots.git
   cd chatbots
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file to set your configuration options.

4. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Environment Configuration

The Chatbot Platform uses environment variables for configuration. The following variables are required:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| NODE_ENV | Environment (development, test, production) | development |
| PORT | HTTP port | 3000 |
| MONGODB_URI | MongoDB connection string | mongodb://localhost:27017/chatbots |
| REDIS_HOST | Redis host | localhost |
| REDIS_PORT | Redis port | 6379 |
| JWT_SECRET | Secret for JWT tokens | (required) |
| REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET | Secret for refresh tokens | (required) |

For a complete list of environment variables, see the `.env.example` file.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

The platform includes a comprehensive security framework with the following features:

- User authentication with password policies
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Policy-based authorization
- Audit logging

Configure these features using the appropriate environment variables in your `.env` file.

### Data Protection

The platform includes data protection features:

- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Sensitive data masking
- Data retention policies
- Legal hold capabilities

Configure these features using the appropriate environment variables in your `.env` file.

### Network Security

For production deployments, consider the following:

- Use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
- Configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) in front of the application
- Implement IP-based access controls if needed
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for additional protection

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks

The platform provides health check endpoints at `/api/health` that can be used for monitoring.

### Logging

Logs are written to the `logs` directory by default. In Docker deployments, logs are available via `docker-compose logs`.

### Backup and Restore

#### Database Backup

1. MongoDB backup:
   ```bash
   mongodump --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017/chatbots" --out=./backup
   ```

2. Restore from backup:
   ```bash
   mongorestore --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017/chatbots" ./backup
   ```

### Upgrading

1. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Update dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Apply database migrations (if any):
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

4. Restart the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection refused to MongoDB or Redis**
   - Check if the services are running
   - Verify connection strings in the `.env` file
   - Check network connectivity between services

2. **Authentication failures**
   - Verify JWT_SECRET and REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET are set correctly
   - Check user credentials in the database

3. **Performance issues**
   - Check system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Review application logs for bottlenecks
   - Consider scaling the application horizontally

## Self-Hosting Best Practices

When self-hosting the Chatbot Platform, consider the following best practices:

1. **Resource Planning**
   - Allocate sufficient CPU, memory, and disk resources
   - Plan for scaling as usage grows
   - Consider redundancy for critical components

2. **Backup Strategy**
   - Implement regular automated backups
   - Test restore procedures periodically
   - Store backups in a separate location

3. **Security**
   - Keep the platform and dependencies updated
   - Implement network security controls
   - Use strong, unique secrets for all environment variables
   - Regularly audit access and permissions

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring for system resources
   - Configure alerts for critical issues
   - Regularly review logs for suspicious activity

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a secure, reliable deployment of the Chatbot Platform in your environment.
