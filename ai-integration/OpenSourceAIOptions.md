# Open-Source AI Options for Test Fix Generation

This document outlines open-source AI options suitable for code analysis and test fix generation in our automated testing framework.

## Requirements

For our test fix generation system, we need AI models that can:

1. Understand code context and test failures
2. Generate accurate code fixes
3. Be deployed locally or self-hosted
4. Comply with our strict open-source policy
5. Handle programming language syntax and semantics
6. Process and generate code snippets

## Open-Source AI Options

### 1. Hugging Face Models

#### CodeLlama

**Description**: Code Llama is a collection of LLMs for code, built on top of Llama 2. It's available in different sizes (7B, 13B, 34B parameters) and variants optimized for different tasks.

**Key Features**:
- Trained on code-specific data
- Supports multiple programming languages
- Can generate code and explain code
- Infilling capabilities (fixing code in context)
- Apache 2.0 license

**Integration Options**:
- Self-hosted via Hugging Face Transformers
- Local deployment with llama.cpp
- Integration via Hugging Face Inference API (self-hosted)

**Resource Requirements**:
- 7B model: ~16GB RAM
- 13B model: ~26GB RAM
- 34B model: ~60GB RAM
- Can be quantized for lower memory requirements

#### StarCoder / StarCoderBase

**Description**: StarCoder models are trained on a large corpus of code from GitHub. They're specifically designed for code understanding and generation.

**Key Features**:
- Trained on 80+ programming languages
- 15B parameter model
- Fill-in-the-middle capability
- BigCode Open RAIL-M license (permissive for commercial use)

**Integration Options**:
- Self-hosted via Hugging Face Transformers
- Local deployment with optimized inference engines

**Resource Requirements**:
- ~30GB RAM for full model
- Can be quantized to reduce memory requirements

### 2. Local LLM Frameworks

#### Ollama

**Description**: Ollama is a framework for running LLMs locally, with easy setup and API access.

**Key Features**:
- Supports multiple open-source models including CodeLlama
- Simple REST API
- Easy model management
- MIT license

**Integration Options**:
- Local REST API
- Command-line interface

**Resource Requirements**:
- Depends on the model used
- Supports quantized models for lower resource usage

#### LocalAI

**Description**: LocalAI is a drop-in replacement for OpenAI API that runs on consumer hardware.

**Key Features**:
- Compatible with OpenAI API
- Supports multiple model backends
- Can run quantized models
- MIT license

**Integration Options**:
- REST API compatible with OpenAI's API
- Docker deployment

**Resource Requirements**:
- Flexible based on model choice
- Supports 4-bit quantization for efficient resource usage

### 3. Self-Hosted Model Servers

#### Text Generation Inference (TGI)

**Description**: Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference is a toolkit for deploying LLMs for text generation.

**Key Features**:
- Optimized for Transformer models
- Supports continuous batching
- Tensor parallelism for large models
- Apache 2.0 license

**Integration Options**:
- REST API
- Docker deployment
- Kubernetes deployment

**Resource Requirements**:
- Scalable based on configuration
- GPU acceleration recommended

#### vLLM

**Description**: vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.

**Key Features**:
- PagedAttention for efficient KV cache management
- Continuous batching
- OpenAI-compatible API
- Apache 2.0 license

**Integration Options**:
- Python API
- REST API
- Docker deployment

**Resource Requirements**:
- GPU recommended
- Optimized for memory efficiency

## Recommendation

For our test fix generation system, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Primary Option**: Deploy CodeLlama (7B or 13B) using Ollama
   - Provides good balance of performance and resource requirements
   - Easy to integrate via REST API
   - Specifically trained for code understanding and generation
   - Can run on modest hardware with quantization

2. **Alternative Option**: StarCoder with LocalAI
   - Good for multilingual code support
   - OpenAI API compatibility makes integration straightforward
   - Permissive license for commercial use

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up local Ollama instance with CodeLlama-7b-Instruct
2. Create an `OllamaServiceConnector` implementing our `AIServiceConnector` interface
3. Develop prompt templates optimized for test failure analysis and fix generation
4. Implement response parsing to extract code fixes
5. Add validation and testing of generated fixes

This approach ensures we comply with our open-source policy while providing effective AI-powered test fix generation capabilities.
