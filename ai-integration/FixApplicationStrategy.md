# Fix Application Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for safely applying AI-generated fixes to the codebase as part of the automated test failure recovery process. The primary goal is to ensure that fixes can be applied without risking data loss or introducing new issues.

## Safety Principles

1. **Non-destructive Operations**: Never overwrite original files without backups
2. **Validation**: Verify fixes improve the situation before finalizing changes
3. **Transparency**: Maintain clear logs of all modifications
4. **Reversibility**: Ensure all changes can be easily reverted
5. **Incremental Application**: Apply fixes one at a time to isolate effects

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. File Backup System

Before applying any fixes:

- Create a timestamped backup directory: `./backups/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS/`
- Copy the original file to the backup directory with its relative path preserved
- Store metadata about the backup (timestamp, reason, test that triggered it)

```javascript
// Example backup structure
backups/
  2025-06-18-22-45-30/
    src/
      utils/
        string-helper.js
    metadata.json  // Contains details about the backup
```

### 2. Fix Application Process

The fix application process follows these steps:

1. **Parse Fix Recommendation**:
   - Extract file path, line numbers, and code snippets from AI recommendations
   - Validate that the file exists and is accessible

2. **Analyze Change Context**:
   - Determine if the change is an insertion, replacement, or deletion
   - Identify the exact location in the file for the change

3. **Apply Changes**:
   - Create a backup of the original file
   - Read the file content
   - Apply the change using one of these strategies:
     - **Line-based replacement**: Replace specific line ranges
     - **Pattern-based replacement**: Find and replace specific code patterns
     - **AST-based modification**: Parse the code into an AST, modify it, and regenerate code (for complex changes)

4. **Verify Syntax**:
   - Perform a syntax check on the modified file
   - Revert to backup if syntax check fails

### 3. Validation Process

After applying fixes:

1. **Re-run Failed Tests**:
   - Run only the specific tests that were failing
   - Compare results with previous runs

2. **Verify No Regressions**:
   - Run a subset of related tests to ensure no regressions
   - If possible, run a quick smoke test of the application

3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If tests pass: Commit the changes and log success
   - If tests still fail: Try alternative fixes or revert changes

### 4. Dry Run Mode

Implement a "dry run" mode that:

- Shows what changes would be made without actually applying them
- Generates a diff of the proposed changes
- Provides confidence metrics for the suggested fixes

### 5. Conflict Resolution

When multiple fixes are suggested:

- Apply fixes in order of confidence score
- If fixes target the same file/lines, apply them sequentially and validate after each
- If conflicts occur, try to merge changes or prioritize based on confidence

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Modification Approaches

1. **Simple Line Replacement**:
   ```javascript
   const lines = fileContent.split('\n');
   lines.splice(startLine - 1, endLine - startLine + 1, newContent);
   const newFileContent = lines.join('\n');
   ```

2. **Pattern-Based Replacement**:
   ```javascript
   const newFileContent = fileContent.replace(patternToReplace, replacementCode);
   ```

3. **AST-Based Modification** (for complex changes):
   ```javascript
   const ast = parser.parse(fileContent);
   // Modify AST nodes
   const newFileContent = generator.generate(ast);
   ```

### Error Handling

- Implement timeout mechanisms for long-running operations
- Catch and log all exceptions during fix application
- Provide detailed error messages with context about what went wrong
- Always ensure backups are created before any modification attempts

## Logging and Reporting

For each fix application:

- Log the original issue (test failure, error message)
- Log the AI recommendation
- Log the exact changes made (file, lines, before/after)
- Log the validation results
- Generate a summary report of all fix attempts and their outcomes

## Security Considerations

- Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Scan AI-generated code for potentially malicious patterns
- Limit the scope of files that can be modified (e.g., no system files)
- Implement permission checks before modifying files

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with version control systems for automatic commits
- Machine learning to improve fix success rates based on historical data
- Support for more complex refactorings that span multiple files
- Interactive mode for human review before applying critical changes
