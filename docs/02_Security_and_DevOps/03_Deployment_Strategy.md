# Deployment Strategy

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Chatbots project, aligned with the `dev_framework` principles.

## Overview

Our deployment strategy focuses on reliability, repeatability, and minimal downtime. We use a containerized approach with orchestration to ensure consistent deployments across environments.

## Deployment Environments

We maintain several environments to support our development and release process:

### Development Environment

- **Purpose**: Daily development and feature testing
- **Deployment Frequency**: Continuous (multiple times per day)
- **Stability**: Experimental, may contain unstable features
- **Data**: Non-sensitive test data
- **Access**: Development team only

### Testing/QA Environment

- **Purpose**: Formal testing and QA
- **Deployment Frequency**: Daily or on-demand
- **Stability**: More stable than development
- **Data**: Anonymized production-like data
- **Access**: Development and QA teams

### Staging Environment

- **Purpose**: Pre-production validation
- **Deployment Frequency**: After QA approval
- **Stability**: Production-like stability
- **Data**: Anonymized production data
- **Access**: Development, QA, and business stakeholders

### Production Environment

- **Purpose**: Live system used by end users
- **Deployment Frequency**: Scheduled releases
- **Stability**: Highly stable
- **Data**: Real production data
- **Access**: Limited to operations team and automated systems

## Containerization Strategy

### Docker Containers

- All application components are containerized using Docker
- Base images are security-scanned and regularly updated
- Multi-stage builds to minimize container size
- Non-root users inside containers
- Immutable containers (no runtime changes)

### Container Registry

- Private container registry with access controls
- Image scanning for vulnerabilities
- Image signing for authenticity verification
- Versioned tags for all images

## Orchestration

### Kubernetes

We use Kubernetes for container orchestration with the following configuration:

- **Namespace Strategy**: Separate namespaces for each environment
- **Pod Security Policies**: Enforce security best practices
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits for all containers
- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes for all services
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal pod autoscaling based on metrics

### Helm Charts

- Templated Kubernetes manifests using Helm
- Environment-specific values files
- Versioned chart releases
- Helm hooks for pre/post deployment actions

## Deployment Workflow

### Continuous Deployment Pipeline

### Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment

For zero-downtime updates of stateless services:

1. Deploy new version (green) alongside existing version (blue)
2. Run smoke tests on green deployment
3. Switch traffic from blue to green
4. Monitor for issues
5. If successful, decommission blue; if issues, rollback to blue

#### Canary Deployment

For gradual rollout of critical services:

1. Deploy new version to a small subset of users (e.g., 5%)
2. Monitor performance and error rates
3. Gradually increase traffic to new version
4. If issues detected, rollback immediately
5. Complete rollout when confidence is high

#### Rolling Updates

For stateful services or when blue-green is not feasible:

1. Update instances one by one or in small batches
2. Verify health before proceeding to next batch
3. Continue until all instances are updated
4. Rollback if issues are detected

## Database Migrations

### Migration Strategy

- Schema migrations are version-controlled
- Backward-compatible changes where possible
- Multi-phase migrations for breaking changes:
  1. Deploy code that supports both old and new schema
  2. Apply schema changes
  3. Deploy code that uses new schema only

### Backup Strategy

- Full backups before migrations
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Automated restoration testing

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Configuration

- Environment variables for runtime configuration
- Kubernetes ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration
- Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data
- External secret management system integration

### Feature Flags

- Runtime toggles for new features
- Gradual feature rollout capability
- A/B testing support
- Emergency kill switches for problematic features

## Monitoring and Observability

### Pre-Deployment Verification

- Automated smoke tests
- Synthetic transactions
- Configuration validation

### Post-Deployment Verification

- Health check endpoints
- Metric baseline comparison
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance monitoring

## Rollback Strategy

### Automated Rollbacks

- Automatic rollback triggers:
  - Error rate exceeds threshold
  - Latency exceeds threshold
  - Failed health checks

### Manual Rollbacks

- Clear rollback procedures
- Single-command rollback capability
- Practicing rollbacks in drills

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Objectives

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss

### Recovery Strategies

- Multi-region deployment capability
- Regular disaster recovery drills
- Documented recovery procedures
- Automated recovery for common scenarios

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

- No hardcoded secrets in code or containers
- Rotation policy for all credentials
- Just-in-time access for manual operations

### Deployment Permissions

- Principle of least privilege
- Separation of duties
- Audit logging for all deployment actions

## Documentation and Compliance

### Deployment Documentation

- Runbooks for common deployment scenarios
- Architecture diagrams
- Network flow documentation
- Dependency maps

### Compliance Requirements

- Change management records
- Approval workflows
- Audit trails
- Compliance scanning
