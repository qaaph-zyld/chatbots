# Community Features

This document provides documentation for community engagement features specific to the Chatbots project.

## Overview

The Chatbots platform includes community features designed to foster user engagement, knowledge sharing, and collaborative improvement of chatbot capabilities. These features enable users to interact with each other, share experiences, and contribute to the platform's development.

## Community Directory

Community-related resources are located in the `/community` directory at the project root. This directory contains subdirectories for different community features, including the forum system.

## Forum System

The forum system (`/community/forum`) provides a platform for users to discuss chatbot development, share experiences, and get help from the community.

### Architecture

The forum system follows a modern web application architecture:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js API with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing forum data
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication integrated with the main platform

### Key Features

1. **Discussion Boards**: Categorized discussion areas for different topics
2. **Thread Management**: Creation, viewing, and responding to discussion threads
3. **User Profiles**: Customizable profiles with activity history and reputation
4. **Moderation Tools**: Reporting, flagging, and content moderation capabilities
5. **Search**: Full-text search across forum content
6. **Notifications**: Email and in-app notifications for replies and mentions

### Integration Points

The forum system integrates with other parts of the Chatbots platform:

- **Authentication**: Shared authentication system with the main platform
- **User Profiles**: Unified user profiles across the platform
- **Activity Tracking**: Forum activity contributes to overall user engagement metrics
- **Knowledge Base**: Selected forum content can be promoted to the knowledge base

### API Endpoints

The forum system exposes the following API endpoints:

```
GET    /api/forum/categories                # List all categories
GET    /api/forum/categories/:id            # Get category details
GET    /api/forum/threads                   # List all threads (with pagination)
GET    /api/forum/threads/:id               # Get thread details
POST   /api/forum/threads                   # Create a new thread
PUT    /api/forum/threads/:id               # Update a thread
DELETE /api/forum/threads/:id               # Delete a thread
GET    /api/forum/threads/:id/posts         # Get posts for a thread
POST   /api/forum/threads/:id/posts         # Add a post to a thread
PUT    /api/forum/posts/:id                 # Update a post
DELETE /api/forum/posts/:id                 # Delete a post
```

### Database Schema

The forum system uses the following MongoDB collections:

```javascript
// Categories collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  description: String,
  slug: String,
  order: Number,
  parentId: ObjectId,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}

// Threads collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  slug: String,
  content: String,
  categoryId: ObjectId,
  authorId: ObjectId,
  isPinned: Boolean,
  isLocked: Boolean,
  viewCount: Number,
  lastPostAt: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}

// Posts collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  threadId: ObjectId,
  content: String,
  authorId: ObjectId,
  isAccepted: Boolean,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Frontend Components

The forum system includes the following key frontend components:

- **CategoryList**: Displays the list of available categories
- **ThreadList**: Shows threads within a category with sorting and filtering
- **ThreadView**: Displays a thread and its posts
- **PostEditor**: Rich text editor for creating and editing posts
- **UserBadge**: Shows user information and reputation

### Permissions System

The forum implements a role-based permissions system:

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| Guest | View public categories and threads |
| User | Create threads and posts, edit own content |
| Moderator | Edit/delete any content, lock threads, manage flags |
| Admin | Manage categories, assign roles, configure settings |

### Gamification Elements

To encourage participation, the forum includes gamification features:

- **Reputation Points**: Earned through positive contributions
- **Badges**: Awarded for specific achievements
- **Leaderboards**: Recognition for top contributors
- **Levels**: Progressive user levels based on activity and reputation

## User Feedback System

In addition to the forum, the Chatbots platform includes a structured feedback system:

### Feedback Collection

- **In-chat Feedback**: Rating and comment collection after chat sessions
- **Surveys**: Periodic user surveys on specific features
- **Feature Requests**: Structured submission of feature ideas
- **Bug Reports**: Streamlined reporting of issues

### Feedback Processing

1. **Categorization**: Automatic categorization of feedback by type and topic
2. **Prioritization**: Scoring system to identify high-impact feedback
3. **Assignment**: Routing to appropriate team members
4. **Status Tracking**: Transparent tracking of feedback status

### Feedback Integration

- **Product Roadmap**: User feedback influences feature prioritization
- **Quality Metrics**: Feedback trends are tracked as key performance indicators
- **Public Dashboard**: Transparent sharing of feedback statistics

## Community Contribution Guidelines

The `/community` directory also contains guidelines for community contributions:

### Code Contributions

- **Coding Standards**: Requirements for contributed code
- **Pull Request Process**: Steps for submitting code changes
- **Review Criteria**: Standards used to evaluate contributions

### Content Contributions

- **Knowledge Base Articles**: Guidelines for contributing to the knowledge base
