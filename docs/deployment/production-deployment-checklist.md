## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues, follow these steps to roll back:

1. Identify the specific component causing the issue
2. If payment-related, switch to maintenance mode for subscription features
3. If analytics-related, disable data collection temporarily
4. Deploy the previous stable version of the affected component
5. Verify that the rollback resolves the issue
6. Communicate with affected users if necessary
