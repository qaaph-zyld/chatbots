# MongoDB Connection Improvements

Last Updated: 2025-06-04 04:39:13

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to MongoDB connection handling in the chatbot platform to address connection issues and improve reliability.

## Problem Statement

The chatbot platform was experiencing MongoDB connection issues, specifically:

1. Connection refused errors (`ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017`)
2. No automatic retry mechanism for failed connections
3. Inconsistent connection configuration across different parts of the application
4. No diagnostics to identify connection issues
5. No persistence of successful connection URIs

## Solution

We implemented several improvements to address these issues:

### 1. Centralized MongoDB Configuration

Created a dedicated MongoDB configuration module (`src/config/mongodb.js`) that:

- Centralizes all MongoDB connection settings
- Provides consistent connection options across the application
- Supports environment-specific configuration
- Allows for easy overrides and customization

```javascript
// Example usage
const mongoConfig = require('../config/mongodb');
const config = mongoConfig.getMongoConfig();
```

### 2. Robust Connection Handling

Enhanced the database service (`src/data/database.service.js`) with:

- Automatic retry mechanism for failed connections
- Configurable retry attempts and delay
- Improved error handling and logging
- Connection event handling

```javascript
// Example of retry logic
let attempts = mongoDbConfig.retry.attempts;
while (attempts > 0) {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(uri, connectionOptions);
    break;
  } catch (err) {
    attempts--;
    if (attempts > 0) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, mongoDbConfig.retry.delay));
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Connection Diagnostics

Created a MongoDB connection diagnostics utility (`src/tests/scripts/mongodb-connection-test.js`) that:

- Tests different MongoDB connection configurations
- Identifies successful connection URIs
- Provides detailed error information
- Saves connection test results for future reference

### 4. Automatic URI Detection and Persistence

Implemented a system to:

- Save successful connection URIs for future use
- Automatically use previously successful URIs
- Fall back to default URIs if no successful connections are found

```javascript
// Example of saving a successful URI
mongoConfig.saveSuccessfulUri(uri);

// Example of loading a previously successful URI
const config = mongoConfig.getMongoConfig();
```

### 5. Enhanced Test Scripts

Updated test scripts with:

- Better error reporting and logging
- Automatic use of previously successful connection URIs
- Detailed test results saved to `test-results` directory

## Benefits

These improvements provide several benefits:

1. **Reliability**: More robust connection handling with automatic retries
2. **Consistency**: Centralized configuration for all MongoDB connections
3. **Diagnostics**: Better tools for identifying and resolving connection issues
4. **Persistence**: Automatic use of previously successful connection URIs
5. **Transparency**: Detailed logs and test results for troubleshooting

## Usage

### Running Connection Diagnostics

```bash
node src/tests/scripts/mongodb-connection-test.js
```

This will:
- Test different MongoDB connection configurations
- Identify successful connection URIs
- Save results to `test-results/manual-test-results.txt`
- Save successful URIs to `test-results/mongodb-connection.json`

### Using the MongoDB Configuration

```javascript
const mongoConfig = require('../config/mongodb');

// Get default configuration
const config = mongoConfig.getMongoConfig();

// Get configuration with overrides
const customConfig = mongoConfig.getMongoConfig({
  uri: 'mongodb://custom-host:27017/chatbots',
  options: {
    maxPoolSize: 20
  }
});
```

### Using the Database Service

```javascript
const databaseService = require('../data/database.service');

// Connect with default configuration
await databaseService.connect();

// Connect with custom options
await databaseService.connect({
  uri: 'mongodb://custom-host:27017/chatbots',
  options: {
    maxPoolSize: 20
  }
});
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Connection Performance**: Track connection success rates and performance
2. **Implement Connection Pooling**: Optimize connection pooling for high-load scenarios
3. **Add Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for MongoDB connections
4. **Automated Testing**: Add automated tests for MongoDB connection handling
5. **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation with new connection handling details
