## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 2-3 Full-stack developers
- 1 UX/UI designer
- 1 DevOps engineer
- 1 QA specialist

### Marketing & Sales
- 1 Product marketing manager
- 1 Content creator
- 1 Sales representative

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **System Uptime**: 99.9%
- **API Response Time**: <100ms average
- **Error Rate**: <0.1%

### Business Metrics
- **User Adoption**: 1,000+ active users within first month
- **Conversion Rate**: 5%+ free-to-paid conversion
- **Retention**: 80%+ monthly retention rate
- **Revenue**: $10,000+ MRR by end of first quarter
- **Customer Satisfaction**: 4.5+ out of 5 rating

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Payment Processing Integration**: Complex integration with security implications
2. **Usage Metering Accuracy**: Critical for customer trust and billing correctness
3. **Performance at Scale**: System must maintain performance as user base grows

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Use established payment processing libraries and follow security best practices
2. Implement comprehensive testing for usage metering with audit trails
3. Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning with load testing

## Conclusion

We are approximately 8-11 weeks away from having a fully monetizable MVP. The technical foundation is strong, with core functionality, testing, and monitoring systems in place. The critical path to monetization involves completing documentation, implementing billing and subscription management, creating a customer portal, and preparing go-to-market materials.

By following this plan, we can transform our technically complete product into a business-ready solution that customers will pay for.
