# Rollback Plan for Chatbot Platform MVP Release

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed rollback procedures for the Chatbot Platform MVP release. A robust rollback plan is essential to minimize downtime and impact on users in case deployment issues arise.

## Rollback Decision Matrix

| Issue Type | Severity | Impact | Rollback Decision |
|------------|----------|--------|------------------|
| Functional Bug | Critical | Core functionality broken | Immediate rollback |
| Functional Bug | High | Important feature broken | Rollback if fix > 2 hours |
| Functional Bug | Medium | Non-critical feature broken | Fix forward if possible |
| Performance | Critical | System unusable | Immediate rollback |
| Performance | High | Significant slowdown | Rollback if fix > 2 hours |
| Performance | Medium | Minor slowdown | Fix forward |
| Security | Critical | Data breach possible | Immediate rollback |
| Security | High | Vulnerability exposed | Immediate rollback |
| Security | Medium | Minor vulnerability | Fix forward if possible |
| Data | Critical | Data corruption | Immediate rollback + recovery |
| Data | High | Data inconsistency | Rollback if fix > 1 hour |

## Rollback Triggers

The following conditions should trigger consideration of a rollback:

1. **Critical Functionality Failure**
   - Authentication system not working
   - Chatbot messaging system not functioning
   - API endpoints returning 5xx errors
   - Database connection failures

2. **Severe Performance Degradation**
   - Response times > 3 seconds for critical operations
   - CPU utilization > 90% for > 5 minutes
   - Memory utilization > 90% for > 5 minutes
   - Database connection pool exhaustion

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Authentication bypass discovered
   - Data exposure vulnerability identified
   - Injection vulnerability detected
   - Unauthorized access possible

4. **Data Integrity Issues**
   - Data corruption detected
   - Inconsistent data state
   - Failed migrations
   - Broken relationships between entities

## Rollback Decision Authority

The following individuals have the authority to make a rollback decision:

- **Primary**: Lead DevOps Engineer
- **Secondary**: Technical Project Manager
- **Tertiary**: CTO

In the absence of the above individuals, a consensus of at least two senior engineers is required to initiate a rollback.

## Pre-Deployment Preparations for Rollback

1. **Database Backups**
   - Take a full backup of all production databases immediately before deployment
   - Verify backup integrity
   - Test restore procedure on staging environment
   - Document backup locations and access procedures

2. **Application State**
   - Tag the current stable version in Git
   - Create a deployment package of the current version
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline can deploy the previous version
   - Verify previous version compatibility with current database schema

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Backup all configuration files
   - Document all environment variables
   - Backup server configurations
   - Ensure previous configuration is available

4. **Communication Plan**
   - Prepare communication templates for rollback scenarios
   - Establish communication channels for deployment team
   - Define escalation paths
   - Prepare user communication for extended downtime

## Rollback Procedures

### Standard Rollback Procedure

1. **Initiate Rollback**
   - Deployment lead announces rollback decision on communication channel
   - All team members acknowledge receipt
   - Deployment lead assigns roles for rollback process

2. **Enable Maintenance Mode**
   - Redirect user traffic to maintenance page
   - Update status page to indicate maintenance
   - Ensure in-progress operations are completed or safely terminated

3. **Rollback Application Code**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to deployment directory
   cd /opt/chatbot-platform
   
   # Pull previous version
   git checkout v0.9.0
   
   # Rebuild application (if necessary)
   npm install
   npm run build
   
   # Restart application
   pm2 restart app
   ```

4. **Verify Application Status**
   - Check application logs for startup errors
   - Verify API endpoints are responding correctly
   - Run basic smoke tests
   - Check monitoring dashboards for error rates

5. **Database Rollback (if necessary)**
   ```bash
   # Stop application to prevent further writes
   pm2 stop app
   
   # Restore database from pre-deployment backup
   mongorestore --uri="mongodb://username:password@host:port" --db=chatbot-platform /backup/pre-deployment/
   
   # Restart application
   pm2 start app
   ```

6. **Verify Database Status**
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify data integrity
   - Run database health checks
   - Check for replication lag (if applicable)

7. **Disable Maintenance Mode**
   - Remove maintenance page
   - Update status page
   - Monitor initial user traffic

8. **Post-Rollback Verification**
   - Verify all critical functionality
   - Check performance metrics
   - Verify third-party integrations
   - Confirm monitoring systems are operational

### Emergency Rollback Procedure

For critical issues requiring immediate action:

1. **Immediate Service Isolation**
   - Activate circuit breakers to isolate affected services
   - Redirect traffic away from affected components
   - Enable emergency maintenance mode

2. **Rapid Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Execute emergency rollback script
   cd /opt/chatbot-platform
   ./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh
   ```

3. **Verify Critical Services**
   - Check authentication services
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Confirm API gateway functionality
   - Test core messaging functions

4. **Gradual Service Restoration**
   - Restore services in order of priority
   - Monitor each service as it comes online
   - Gradually increase traffic to each service

## Post-Rollback Actions

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Collect logs from the failed deployment
   - Analyze monitoring data around the failure time
   - Review deployment steps that led to the issue
   - Document findings in incident report

2. **Communication**
   - Notify all stakeholders of rollback completion
   - Provide estimated timeline for retry
   - Update status page
   - Prepare customer communications if service was impacted

3. **Issue Resolution**
   - Create tickets for issues that caused the rollback
   - Prioritize fixes based on severity
   - Implement and test fixes in development/staging
   - Update deployment plan to address identified issues

4. **Deployment Retry Planning**
   - Review and revise deployment plan
   - Add additional verification steps
   - Consider phased deployment approach
   - Schedule new deployment window

## Rollback Testing

Prior to the production deployment, the rollback plan should be tested in the staging environment:

1. **Simulated Deployment**
   - Deploy new version to staging
   - Verify functionality
   - Intentionally trigger rollback conditions

2. **Rollback Execution**
   - Execute rollback procedures
   - Measure time to complete rollback
   - Verify system returns to previous state

3. **Process Refinement**
   - Identify bottlenecks in rollback process
   - Refine procedures based on testing
   - Update documentation
