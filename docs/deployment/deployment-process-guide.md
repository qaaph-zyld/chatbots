# Deployment Process Guide

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive information about the deployment process for the Chatbot Platform. It covers the CI/CD pipeline, blue/green deployment strategy, verification tests, monitoring, and rollback procedures.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of the following stages:

### 1. Lint

- Runs ESLint to ensure code quality and consistency
- Blocks the pipeline if linting errors are found

### 2. Test

- Runs unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- Generates test coverage reports
- Blocks the pipeline if tests fail

### 3. Security Scan

- Runs npm audit to check for vulnerable dependencies
- Runs OWASP Dependency Check for deeper security analysis
- Generates security reports
- Blocks the pipeline if high-severity vulnerabilities are found

### 4. Build

- Builds the application for production
- Generates build artifacts
- Blocks the pipeline if build fails

### 5. Docker Build

- Builds a Docker image for the application
- Pushes the image to GitHub Container Registry
- Tags the image with branch name, PR number, version, and SHA

### 6. Deploy

- Deploys the application to the appropriate environment (development, staging, or production)
- Uses blue/green deployment strategy for production
- Runs verification tests before switching traffic
- Automatically rolls back if verification tests fail

### 7. Notify

- Sends notifications about deployment status
- Integrates with Slack for real-time updates

### 8. Deployment Report

- Generates comprehensive deployment reports
- Tracks deployment success rates and issues

## Blue/Green Deployment Strategy

We use a blue/green deployment strategy for production deployments to minimize downtime and risk:

### Process

1. Two identical production environments are maintained: blue and green
2. Only one environment is active at a time and receives production traffic
3. New deployments are made to the inactive environment
4. Verification tests are run against the new deployment
5. If verification tests pass, traffic is switched to the new environment
6. If verification tests fail, the deployment is rolled back

### Benefits

- Zero downtime deployments
- Easy rollback by switching traffic back to the previous environment
- Ability to test the new version in a production-like environment before exposing it to users
- Reduced risk of deployment failures affecting users

## Deployment Verification

We run several types of verification tests after deployment to ensure the application is functioning correctly:

### 1. Smoke Tests

- Basic functionality tests to verify the application is running
- Checks critical endpoints and features
- Fast-running tests that provide immediate feedback

### 2. UI Verification Tests

- Tests the user interface to ensure it's functioning correctly
- Verifies key user flows and interactions
- Uses Playwright for browser automation

### 3. Performance Verification Tests

- Measures response times for critical endpoints
- Verifies the application meets performance requirements
- Tests under simulated load conditions

### 4. Security Verification Tests

- Verifies security headers and configurations
- Tests authentication and authorization
- Checks for common security vulnerabilities

### Automated Verification Process

1. Deployment is made to the inactive environment
2. Verification tests are run against the new deployment
3. If all tests pass, traffic is switched to the new environment
4. If any tests fail, the deployment is automatically rolled back

## Monitoring and Alerting

We use the following tools and metrics to monitor deployments:

### Metrics Collection

- CPU and memory usage
- Network traffic
- HTTP request rates and error rates
- Response latency (p50, p90, p99)
- Database connections and operations
- Business metrics (active users, conversations, messages)

### Health Checks

- API health endpoint
- API readiness endpoint
- Database connectivity
- External service connectivity

### Alerting

- Alerts are sent to Slack for critical issues
- Email notifications for deployment status
- Microsoft Teams integration for team-wide visibility

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback

The CI/CD pipeline automatically rolls back deployments if verification tests fail:

1. Traffic is switched back to the previous environment
2. Notifications are sent about the rollback
3. The rollback is recorded in the rollback history

### Manual Rollback

To manually roll back a deployment:

1. Run the rollback script:
   ```
   node scripts/rollback-deployment.js
   ```

2. Or use kubectl directly:
   ```
   kubectl patch service chatbot-platform -n chatbot-platform-prod -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"color":"blue"}}}'
   ```
   (Replace "blue" with the color of the previous deployment)

### Rollback Verification

After a rollback, verify that:

1. The application is accessible
2. The health endpoint returns a 200 OK response
3. Basic functionality is working

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All tests pass in the CI pipeline
- [ ] Security scans show no high-severity vulnerabilities
- [ ] The application has been tested in a staging environment
- [ ] Database migrations are backward compatible
- [ ] API changes are backward compatible
- [ ] Documentation has been updated
- [ ] The team has been notified about the deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Verification Tests Failing

- Check the test logs for specific failures
- Verify the application is running correctly in the new environment
- Check for environment-specific issues

#### Traffic Not Switching

- Verify the Kubernetes service selector was updated
- Check for DNS propagation issues
- Verify the new deployment is healthy

#### High Error Rates After Deployment

- Check application logs for errors
- Verify database connections and external service connectivity
- Consider rolling back if issues persist

### Getting Help

- Contact the DevOps team for deployment issues
- Check the #deployments Slack channel for recent discussions
- Refer to the deployment logs and reports for detailed information
