# Development Best Practices

## Code Quality and Standards

1. **Consistent Coding Style**
   - Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
   - Use TypeScript for type safety, especially for new components
   - Document all public APIs and complex functions with JSDoc comments
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions across the codebase

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Write unit tests for all core functionality
   - Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
   - Include integration tests for critical paths
   - Implement end-to-end tests for key user journeys
   - Create test scripts to demonstrate feature functionality
   - Test with proxy settings (104.129.196.38:10563) when applicable

3. **Version Control**
   - Use feature branches for all new development
   - Create descriptive commit messages following conventional commits
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized

4. **Documentation**
   - Maintain up-to-date architecture documentation
   - Document all APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Include setup instructions for new developers
   - Document design decisions and trade-offs

## Project Management

1. **Roadmap Adherence**
   - Always align work with the established roadmap
   - Prioritize tasks based on roadmap phases
   - Update roadmap quarterly or when significant changes occur
   - Track progress against roadmap milestones

2. **Issue Management**
   - Use GitHub Issues for tracking bugs and features
   - Label issues appropriately (bug, enhancement, etc.)
   - Estimate complexity using story points
   - Maintain a prioritized backlog

3. **Sprint Planning**
   - Work in 2-week sprint cycles
   - Set clear sprint goals aligned with roadmap
   - Hold regular sprint planning, review, and retrospective meetings
   - Maintain a sustainable development pace

4. **Communication**
   - Document all technical decisions
   - Keep stakeholders informed of progress
   - Address blockers promptly
   - Share knowledge across the team

## Architecture and Design

1. **Modularity**
   - Design with clear separation of concerns
   - Create well-defined interfaces between components
   - Minimize dependencies between modules
   - Make components reusable where appropriate

2. **Scalability**
   - Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning
   - Implement caching strategies where appropriate
   - Consider performance implications of design decisions
   - Plan for increased load and data volume

3. **Security**
   - Follow OWASP security guidelines
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Ensure proper proxy configuration (104.129.196.38:10563) for external requests
   - Implement API key management for external integrations
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

4. **Maintainability**
   - Keep technical debt under control
   - Refactor when necessary
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Document complex algorithms and business logic

## Development Workflow

1. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**
   - Automate testing in CI pipeline
   - Implement automated code quality checks
   - Use staging environments for pre-production testing
   - Implement feature flags for controlled rollouts

2. **Code Reviews**
   - Review all code changes before merging
   - Focus on logic, security, and maintainability
   - Use automated tools to catch style issues
   - Share knowledge during reviews

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Audit dependencies for security issues
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds
   - Ensure all dependencies are open-source compatible
   - Document proxy requirements (104.129.196.38:10563) for dependencies that make external requests
   - Prefer local processing over cloud-based services

4. **Monitoring and Feedback**
   - Implement logging for important events
   - Set up error tracking and alerting
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Collect user feedback systematically

## Learning and Improvement

1. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Hold regular tech talks or learning sessions
   - Document lessons learned
   - Share interesting articles and resources
   - Encourage pair programming for complex tasks

2. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regularly review and update best practices
   - Learn from mistakes and near-misses
   - Stay current with industry trends
   - Experiment with new technologies in controlled ways
