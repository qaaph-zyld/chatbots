# Voice Interface MVP Checklist

This document outlines the remaining tasks and verification steps needed before the MVP release of the open-source voice interface components.

## Security Fixes

- [ ] Run the security audit script (`utils/run-voice-security-audit.js`)
- [ ] Execute the automated fixes script (`scripts/run-security-fixes.js`)
- [ ] Review the security fixes report in `reports/security-fixes-report.md`
- [ ] Manually address any remaining security issues that couldn't be fixed automatically
- [ ] Verify all security issues are resolved with a final security audit

## Performance Verification

- [ ] Run the performance tests in the acceptance test suite
- [ ] Verify performance across all optimization profiles:
  - [ ] High Performance
  - [ ] Balanced
  - [ ] Low Resource
  - [ ] Minimal
- [ ] Test on at least three different hardware configurations:
  - [ ] High-end server
  - [ ] Standard desktop/laptop
  - [ ] Resource-constrained device (e.g., Raspberry Pi or equivalent)
- [ ] Ensure all components meet performance thresholds defined in the test suite

## User Acceptance Testing

- [ ] Run the automated acceptance tests (`tests/acceptance/voice-interface.test.js`)
- [ ] Conduct manual testing based on the test plan in `docs/VOICE_TESTING_PLAN.md`
- [ ] Test all voice components in an integrated environment:
  - [ ] Audio processing
  - [ ] Language detection
  - [ ] Model management
  - [ ] Voice recognition
- [ ] Verify cross-component functionality (e.g., audio processing + voice recognition)
- [ ] Test with real-world audio samples in various environments:
  - [ ] Quiet environment
  - [ ] Background noise
  - [ ] Multiple speakers
  - [ ] Different accents and languages

## Documentation Verification

- [ ] Review all voice interface documentation for accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Ensure API references are up-to-date with the current implementation
- [ ] Verify all code examples in the documentation work as expected
- [ ] Check that environment variables and configuration options are documented
- [ ] Validate installation and setup instructions

## Integration Verification

- [ ] Test integration with the main chatbot platform
- [ ] Verify voice components work with the web interface
- [ ] Test compatibility with supported browsers and devices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and user feedback during voice interactions

## Final Checks

- [ ] Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Verify all environment configurations work as expected
- [ ] Check for any outdated dependencies that need updates
- [ ] Ensure all TODOs and FIXMEs in the code have been addressed
- [ ] Conduct a final code review of all voice components

## Release Preparation

- [ ] Update version numbers in package.json and other relevant files
- [ ] Prepare release notes documenting features, improvements, and fixes
- [ ] Create a tagged release in the version control system
- [ ] Prepare deployment instructions for users
- [ ] Update the project website with information about the voice interface

## Post-Release Monitoring

- [ ] Set up monitoring for the voice components in production
- [ ] Establish a process for collecting user feedback
- [ ] Create a plan for addressing issues discovered after release
- [ ] Schedule regular security and performance audits
