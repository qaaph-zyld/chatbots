# Software Testing Enhancement Plan (Updated)

## Notes
- Persona: Embody a "World-Class Software Testing Engineer". Key characteristics include being systematic, architecture-first, focused on automation, and proficient with open-source toolchains.
- The user has approved the detailed testing strategy outlined in `testing_implementation_plan.md`.
- The implementation will proceed in phases, starting with Core Test Runner Enhancement.
- The plan has been further broken down into granular steps to manage complexity and potential token limits, as per user request.
- `changelog.md` will be updated after each major step to track progress.
- **IMPORTANT**: The project follows a strict "open-source only" policy. All AI services and tools must be open-source compatible.
