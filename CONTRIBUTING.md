## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report:**
- Check the [issues](https://github.com/Pavleee23/chatbots/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.
- Perform a quick search to see if the problem has been reported already.

**How to Submit A Good Bug Report:**
- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots or animated GIFs if possible.
- Include details about your configuration and environment.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

- Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in.

**How to Submit A Good Enhancement Suggestion:**
- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users.
- List some other applications where this enhancement exists, if applicable.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/Pavleee23/chatbots/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/Pavleee23/chatbots/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#coding-standards)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
