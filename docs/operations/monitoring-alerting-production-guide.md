{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-05T11:30:00Z",
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "monitoring",
      "status": "healthy",
      "latency": 42
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Metrics Collection Verification

```bash
# Submit a test metric
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/api/monitoring/metrics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: test-tenant" \
  -d '{
    "name": "test_metric",
    "value": 50,
    "timestamp": "2025-07-05T11:35:00Z",
    "metadata": {
      "environment": "production",
      "host": "test-host"
    }
  }'
```

### 3. Alert Generation Verification

```bash
# Submit a high CPU metric to trigger an alert
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/api/monitoring/metrics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: test-tenant" \
  -d '{
    "name": "cpu_usage",
    "value": 95,
    "timestamp": "2025-07-05T11:40:00Z",
    "metadata": {
      "environment": "production",
      "host": "test-host"
    }
  }'

# Verify alert was created
curl https://api.example.com/api/alerts?source=cpu_usage&resolved=false \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: test-tenant"
```

### 4. Dashboard Verification

1. Navigate to `https://dashboard.example.com/monitoring`
2. Verify metrics are being displayed
3. Verify alerts are being displayed
4. Test filtering and time range selection

## Monitoring the Monitoring System

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Metric Collection Rate**: Number of metrics collected per minute
2. **Alert Generation Rate**: Number of alerts generated per hour
3. **Notification Delivery Success Rate**: Percentage of notifications successfully delivered
4. **API Latency**: Response time for monitoring and alerting API endpoints
5. **Database Query Performance**: Execution time for metric and alert queries

### Alert Configuration for the Monitoring System

```javascript
// Self-monitoring alerts
module.exports = {
  metric_collection_failure: {
    condition: "metrics.collected.rate < 10 per minute",
    level: "critical",
    message: "Metric collection rate has dropped below threshold"
  },
  notification_delivery_failure: {
    condition: "notifications.delivery.success < 95%",
    level: "critical",
    message: "Notification delivery success rate has dropped below threshold"
  },
  monitoring_api_latency: {
    condition: "api.monitoring.latency > 500ms",
    level: "warning",
    message: "Monitoring API latency has exceeded threshold"
  }
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Metric Collection Issues

**Symptom**: Metrics are not being collected or are delayed.

**Solutions**:
1. Check network connectivity between services
2. Verify metric collection service is running
3. Check database connection and write permissions
4. Inspect logs for collection errors

#### Alert Generation Issues

**Symptom**: Alerts are not being generated for threshold violations.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify alert thresholds are correctly configured
2. Check alert service logs for processing errors
3. Ensure metric data is properly formatted
4. Test alert generation with a manual high-value metric

#### Notification Delivery Issues

**Symptom**: Alerts are generated but notifications are not delivered.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify notification channel configurations
2. Check external service connectivity (email server, Slack API)
3. Inspect notification service logs for delivery errors
4. Test notification delivery with a manual alert

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

The monitoring and alerting system is designed to scale horizontally. To handle increased load:

1. Deploy additional metric collection instances
2. Scale alert processing workers based on queue size
3. Implement read replicas for the metrics database
4. Use a distributed cache for frequently accessed data

### Retention Policies

Configure appropriate retention policies to manage database growth:

```javascript
// Retention configuration
module.exports = {
  metrics: {
    highResolution: {
      retention: "7 days",
      aggregation: "none"
    },
    mediumResolution: {
      retention: "30 days",
      aggregation: "hourly"
    },
    lowResolution: {
      retention: "365 days",
      aggregation: "daily"
    }
  },
  alerts: {
    active: {
      retention: "unlimited"
    },
    resolved: {
      retention: "90 days"
    }
  }
};
```

## Security Considerations

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

The system enforces strict multi-tenant isolation:

1. All API endpoints require tenant identification
2. Database queries include tenant filters
3. Dashboard access is restricted by tenant
4. Notification delivery respects tenant boundaries

### Access Control

Implement role-based access control for monitoring and alerting:

```javascript
// Access control configuration
module.exports = {
  roles: {
    viewer: {
      permissions: ["metrics:read", "alerts:read"]
    },
    operator: {
      permissions: ["metrics:read", "alerts:read", "alerts:acknowledge", "alerts:resolve"]
    },
    administrator: {
      permissions: ["metrics:read", "metrics:write", "alerts:read", "alerts:write", "alerts:acknowledge", "alerts:resolve", "config:read", "config:write"]
    }
  }
};
```

## Conclusion

The monitoring and alerting system is now ready for production deployment. All components have been thoroughly tested and validated through end-to-end tests, confirming their operational readiness. Follow this guide to ensure a smooth deployment and reliable operation in the production environment.
