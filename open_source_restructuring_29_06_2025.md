4. **NLP Processing**: spaCy + NLTK for advanced text processing

## Automation Framework Implementation

### Development Automation
1. **Code Generation**: Implement template-based scaffolding system
2. **Testing Automation**: Extend current AI-enhanced testing with property-based testing
3. **Documentation Generation**: Automated API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
4. **Dependency Management**: Automated security scanning and updates

### Operational Automation
1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform + Ansible for environment provisioning
2. **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes HPA with custom metrics
3. **Backup Automation**: Automated database backups with retention policies
4. **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability assessment pipeline

## Project Reorganization Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Strengthening (Weeks 1-2)

# AI Coder Prompt for IDE Implementation

## Context and Objectives

You are tasked with reorganizing and enhancing a chatbot platform repository following strict open source requirements. The project must maintain all existing features while implementing a comprehensive automation framework and production-ready architecture.

## Technical Requirements

### Mandatory Constraints
- **Open Source Only**: All components, libraries, and tools must be open source licensed
- **Feature Preservation**: No existing functionality may be removed without explicit authorization
- **Automation Priority**: Every process must be automated where technically feasible
- **Documentation Standard**: All code changes require comprehensive documentation updates

### Architecture Specifications

#### Database Layer Implementation
```javascript
// Priority 1: Complete MongoDB integration
// Files to modify: src/data/repositories/*.js
// Requirements:
- Implement connection pooling with mongoose
- Add transaction support for critical operations
- Create migration system for schema changes
- Implement data validation at repository level
```

#### Context Management System
```javascript
// Priority 2: Conversation context persistence
// New files: src/modules/context/
// Requirements:
- Session-based context storage in Redis
- Context expiration policies
- Context sharing between chatbot instances
- Context analytics and insights
```

#### Knowledge Base Integration
```javascript
// Priority 3: Vector search implementation
// New files: src/modules/knowledge/
// Requirements:
- Integration with Weaviate or Chroma vector database
- Document embedding pipeline using open source models
- Semantic search capabilities
- Knowledge base CRUD operations
```

### Automation Implementation Tasks

#### 1. Infrastructure Automation
```yaml
# Create: infrastructure/
# Requirements:
- Docker Compose for local development
- Kubernetes manifests for production deployment
- Terraform modules for cloud infrastructure
- Helm charts for application deployment
```

#### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
```yaml
# Modify: .github/workflows/
# Requirements:
- Multi-stage build process
- Automated testing across multiple Node.js versions
- Security scanning with Snyk or similar open source tools
- Automated dependency updates with Dependabot
```

#### 3. Monitoring and Observability
```javascript
// Create: src/monitoring/
// Requirements:
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Structured logging with Winston
