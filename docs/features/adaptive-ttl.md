# Adaptive TTL Cache System

## Overview

The Adaptive Time-To-Live (TTL) cache system dynamically adjusts cache expiration times based on resource usage patterns, improving cache efficiency and application performance. This feature optimizes memory usage while maintaining high hit rates for frequently accessed resources.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic TTL Calculation**: Automatically adjusts cache expiration times based on access patterns
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Considers access frequency, miss rates, and latency when determining optimal TTL
- **Configurable Weights**: Customize the importance of each factor in TTL calculations
- **Resource Access Tracking**: Monitors and visualizes how resources are being accessed
- **Decay Mechanism**: Gradually reduces access counts to prevent stale data from influencing TTL calculations

## How It Works

The Adaptive TTL system uses three primary factors to calculate the optimal TTL for each cached resource:

1. **Access Frequency**: How often a resource is requested
2. **Miss Rate**: How frequently cache misses occur for a resource
3. **Latency**: How long it takes to generate/fetch the resource when not cached

These factors are combined using configurable weights to determine the optimal TTL within defined minimum and maximum bounds.

### TTL Calculation Formula

```
TTL = defaultTTL + adjustment

Where adjustment is calculated as:
adjustment = (accessFrequencyFactor * accessFrequencyWeight) +
            (missRateFactor * missRateWeight) +
            (latencyFactor * latencyWeight)
```

The final TTL is always constrained between `minTTL` and `maxTTL` to ensure reasonable cache behavior.

## Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | Enable/disable adaptive TTL functionality | `true` |
| `defaultTTL` | Base TTL value in seconds | `300` |
| `minTTL` | Minimum allowed TTL in seconds | `60` |
| `maxTTL` | Maximum allowed TTL in seconds | `3600` |
| `decayInterval` | How often access counts decay (seconds) | `3600` |
| `decayFactor` | Multiplier for decay (0-1) | `0.5` |
| `weights.accessFrequency` | Weight for access frequency factor | `0.5` |
| `weights.missRate` | Weight for miss rate factor | `0.3` |
| `weights.latency` | Weight for latency factor | `0.2` |

## Admin Dashboard

The Adaptive TTL system can be configured through the Cache Metrics Dashboard in the admin panel. The dashboard provides:

1. **Configuration Controls**: Adjust TTL settings and factor weights
2. **Resource Access Visualization**: View access patterns for cached resources
3. **Manual Decay**: Trigger decay of access counts on demand

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Log in with admin credentials
2. Navigate to Admin → Cache Metrics Dashboard
3. Select the "Adaptive TTL" tab

### Configuration Tips

- **High Traffic Applications**: Increase `accessFrequency` weight to prioritize frequently accessed resources
- **API-Heavy Applications**: Increase `latency` weight to keep expensive operations cached longer
- **Memory-Constrained Environments**: Lower `maxTTL` and increase `decayFactor` to more aggressively expire cache entries

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for programmatic control of the Adaptive TTL system:

### Cache Configuration
- `GET /api/metrics/cache/adaptive-ttl`: Get current adaptive TTL configuration
- `PUT /api/metrics/cache/adaptive-ttl`: Update adaptive TTL configuration

### Access Tracking
- `GET /api/metrics/cache/access-tracking`: Get resource access tracking data
- `POST /api/metrics/cache/decay-access`: Manually trigger decay of resource access counts

### Cache Efficiency
- `GET /api/cache-efficiency/report`: Get cache efficiency comparison report
- `POST /api/cache-efficiency/initialize`: Initialize or reset cache efficiency monitoring
- `GET /api/cache-efficiency/status`: Get current status of cache efficiency monitoring
- `POST /api/cache-efficiency/weights/tune`: Automatically tune the weights used in TTL calculation
- `POST /api/cache-efficiency/weights/reset`: Reset weights to their original values

All endpoints require admin authentication.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with the default weights and adjust based on observed performance
2. **Monitor Impact**: Watch cache hit rates and application performance after making configuration changes
3. **Balance Memory and Performance**: Higher TTLs improve hit rates but consume more memory
4. **Regular Maintenance**: Consider scheduling automatic decay during off-peak hours

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Low hit rates | TTL values too low | Increase `defaultTTL` or adjust weights |
| High memory usage | TTL values too high | Decrease `maxTTL` or increase `decayFactor` |
| Stale data | Decay not occurring | Check `decayInterval` or manually trigger decay |
| Inconsistent performance | Unbalanced weights | Adjust factor weights based on application needs |

## Automated Weight Tuning

The system includes an automated weight tuning feature that optimizes the weights used in TTL calculations based on historical performance data.

### How It Works

The automated tuning process:

1. Analyzes historical cache access patterns and performance metrics
2. Identifies optimal weight combinations through statistical analysis
3. Adjusts weights to maximize hit rates while minimizing memory usage
4. Validates the new weights against recent performance data

### Using Automated Tuning

#### Via Admin Dashboard
1. Navigate to Admin → Cache Metrics Dashboard
2. Select the "Adaptive TTL" tab
3. Click "Auto-Tune Weights" button
4. Review the suggested weight changes
5. Apply or reject the suggested changes

#### Via API
- `POST /api/cache-efficiency/weights/tune`: Trigger automated weight tuning
- `POST /api/cache-efficiency/weights/reset`: Reset weights to default values

### Best Practices for Weight Tuning

- Run auto-tuning during periods of typical application usage
- Allow at least 24-48 hours of data collection before tuning
- Review performance metrics after tuning to confirm improvements
- Consider seasonal or cyclical usage patterns when interpreting results

## Future Enhancements

- Resource-specific TTL configurations
- Integration with system-wide monitoring tools
- Visualization of TTL effectiveness over time
- Machine learning-based predictive TTL adjustments
