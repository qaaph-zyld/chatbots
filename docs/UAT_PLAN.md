# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) plan for the Chatbot Platform MVP release. UAT is the final phase of testing where actual users test the software to ensure it meets their requirements and can handle real-world scenarios.

## Objectives

1. Validate that the Chatbot Platform meets all specified business requirements
2. Ensure the platform is user-friendly and intuitive
3. Identify any issues or bugs that were not caught in earlier testing phases
4. Gather user feedback for future improvements
5. Confirm the platform is ready for production deployment

## Test Environment

### Setup Requirements

- Production-like environment with similar hardware specifications
- Complete dataset with realistic test data
- All integrations configured and operational
- Network conditions similar to production
- User accounts with different permission levels

### Access Requirements

- Test users should have appropriate credentials
- Documentation on how to access the test environment
- Contact information for technical support during testing

## Test Participants

### User Roles

1. **Administrators** - Users who will manage the platform
2. **Chatbot Creators** - Users who will build and customize chatbots
3. **End Users** - Users who will interact with the deployed chatbots
4. **Integration Partners** - Users who will integrate chatbots with external platforms

### Participant Selection Criteria
