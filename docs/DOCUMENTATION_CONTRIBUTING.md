# Contributing to Documentation

This guide provides instructions for contributing to the project's documentation framework, which has been reorganized to align with the `dev_framework` principles.

## Documentation Framework Overview

The documentation is organized into four main categories:

1. **01_Testing_Strategies**: Documentation related to testing methodologies and best practices
2. **02_Security_and_DevOps**: Documentation related to security practices and operational considerations
3. **03_Development_Methodologies**: Documentation related to coding standards and architectural patterns
4. **04_Project_Specifics**: Documentation for project-specific aspects that don't fit neatly into the standard categories

## Contributing Process

### 1. Identify the Appropriate Category

Before creating new documentation, determine which category it belongs to:

- **Testing Strategies**: For documentation related to unit testing, integration testing, E2E testing, or test automation
- **Security and DevOps**: For documentation related to security practices, CI/CD pipeline, deployment strategies, or monitoring
- **Development Methodologies**: For documentation related to code standards, architecture patterns, API design, or component structure
- **Project Specifics**: For documentation related to custom components, prompt engineering, community features, or other project-specific aspects

### 2. Create a New Markdown File

1. Navigate to the appropriate directory (e.g., `docs/01_Testing_Strategies/`)
2. Create a new Markdown file following the naming convention: `XX_Descriptive_Name.md`
   - `XX` is the next available number in the directory (e.g., if the last file is `03_E2E_Testing.md`, use `04_` for your new file)
   - Use underscores to separate words in the filename
   - Be descriptive but concise in the filename

### 3. Follow the Documentation Template

Use this template for new documentation files:

```markdown
# [Title of Documentation]

## Overview

[Brief description of what this documentation covers]

## Purpose

[Explain the purpose of this documentation and why it's important]

## Details

[Main content of the documentation]

### [Subsection 1]

[Content for subsection 1]

### [Subsection 2]

[Content for subsection 2]

## Best Practices

[List of best practices related to this topic]

## References

[Any references or related documentation]
```

### 4. Update Related Files

After creating new documentation:

1. Update the README.md file in the directory to include a reference to your new file
2. Update the main docs/README.md if necessary
3. Update the CHANGELOG.md in the project root to reflect your documentation changes

## Documentation Review Process

All documentation changes should go through a review process:

1. **Self-Review**: Ensure your documentation is clear, concise, and follows the established format
2. **Peer Review**: Have at least one team member review your documentation for accuracy and clarity
3. **Technical Review**: For technical documentation, ensure that the technical content is accurate and up-to-date
4. **Final Review**: A project maintainer will review the documentation before merging

## Documentation Style Guide

### Formatting

- Use Markdown formatting consistently
- Use headings (# for main heading, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
- Use code blocks with language specification for code examples (```javascript)
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for lists
- Use tables for tabular data
- Use bold or italic for emphasis, not ALL CAPS

### Writing Style

- Be clear and concise
- Use active voice
- Define acronyms and technical terms
- Include examples where appropriate
- Link to related documentation
- Keep paragraphs short and focused

## Documentation Maintenance

Documentation should be treated as a first-class citizen in the project:

- Update documentation when code changes
- Review documentation regularly for accuracy
- Remove outdated documentation
- Keep the structure consistent with the `dev_framework` principles

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the documentation framework:

1. Check the [Documentation README](./README.md) for guidance
2. Consult with the team lead or documentation maintainer
3. Refer to the `dev_framework` principles for clarification

## Questions and Support

If you have questions about contributing to documentation, please reach out to the documentation maintainer or open an issue with the label "documentation".
