## Entry #1 - Project Assessment

**Status**: Phase 1-2 (~15-20% of Roadmap)
**Focus**: Core Architecture and Basic Functionality
**Next Milestone**: Complete Basic Chatbot Functionality

---

Initial assessment of the codebase shows a well-structured foundation with core architecture in place. The project follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns.

## Key Accomplishments
- ‚úÖ Project directory structure created and organized
- ‚úÖ Core architecture established with modular design
- ‚úÖ Base engine abstractions implemented (Botpress, Hugging Face)
- ‚úÖ NLP processing framework created
- ‚úÖ API structure set up with controllers and routes
- ‚úÖ Database schemas defined for MongoDB
- ‚úÖ Template system for conversation flows implemented

## Current Challenges
- Database integration not fully implemented
- Conversation state management incomplete
- Testing framework needs to be established
- Documentation requires expansion

## Next Steps
- Complete message handling system
- Implement conversation state persistence
- Set up testing framework with initial tests
- Expand documentation for existing components

## Technical Notes
The project uses a factory pattern for engine creation, allowing for easy extension with new AI engines. The NLP system is modular with different processors that can be swapped based on requirements. The current implementation includes placeholders for actual API integrations with Botpress and Hugging Face.
